## Overview

Google DeepMind was formed in 2023 from the merger of DeepMind and Google Brain. DeepMind, founded in 2010 and acquired by Google in 2014, is known for landmark achievements including AlphaGo (defeating world Go champion), AlphaFold (protein structure prediction), and Gemini (multimodal AI system).

The lab combines fundamental research with deployment through Google's products, giving it massive scale and computational resources.

## Core Approach

DeepMind's safety philosophy emphasizes:

1. **Capability research informs safety** - Understanding how systems work enables safer design
2. **Scalable evaluation** - Developing benchmarks and testing methodologies
3. **Responsible development** - Internal review processes before deployment
4. **Beneficial applications** - Directing AI toward scientific breakthroughs (AlphaFold, weather prediction)

## Safety Research Areas

### Scalable Oversight Research
Work on AI-assisted evaluation, debate, and recursive reward modeling for supervising advanced AI systems.

### Specification & Alignment
Research on how to specify what we want from AI systems, including work on reward modeling and preference learning.

### Governance & Policy
Active engagement with AI governance, including contributions to international AI safety discussions and the UK AI Safety Summit.

### Evaluation & Red Teaming
Frontier Safety Team focused on systematic evaluation of dangerous capabilities before deployment.

## Key Achievements

### AlphaGo / AlphaZero (2016-2017)
Defeated world champions in Go and Chess using reinforcement learning and self-play.

### AlphaFold (2020-2022)
Solved protein structure prediction, releasing predictions for nearly all known proteins. Major contribution to biology.

### Gemini (2023-present)
Multimodal AI system competing with GPT-4, integrated across Google products.
