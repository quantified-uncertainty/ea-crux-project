## Overview

AI capability proliferation refers to the **spread of advanced AI capabilities from frontier labs to broader actors** over time. Unlike physical technologies, AI capabilities can be **copied perfectly**, **transmitted instantly**, and **reverse-engineered** from outputs, creating unique proliferation dynamics.

This model analyzes the mechanisms, timescales, and governance challenges of AI diffusion.

## Theoretical Framework

### Information Diffusion Model

AI capabilities are **information goods** with distinctive properties:

```
Traditional goods:
- Rivalrous (my use prevents yours)
- Costly to copy
- Localized

Information goods (AI):
- Non-rivalrous (my use doesn't prevent yours)
- Near-zero marginal cost to copy
- Global distribution
```

**Implication:** Containment is fundamentally difficult

### Diffusion Curve

**Classic S-curve diffusion:**

```
Adoption(t) = L / (1 + exp(-k(t - t_0)))

Where:
- L = ultimate adoption level
- k = diffusion rate
- t_0 = inflection point
```

**AI capability diffusion exhibits:**
- **Shorter timeframes** (months-years vs. decades for previous tech)
- **Steeper curves** (rapid acceleration once started)
- **Higher asymptotic levels** (approaches 100% accessibility)

**Example:**
- GPT-2: Withheld 9 months for safety → Released when proven safe
- GPT-3: API access only → Similar capabilities open-sourced in 18 months (GPT-NeoX, BLOOM)
- GPT-4: Proprietary → Approaching open-source parity in 24 months (LLaMA 3, Mistral)

**Trend:** Time from frontier to open-source is **decreasing**

## Proliferation Mechanisms

### 1. Publication and Open Science

**Mechanism:** Research findings enable replication

**Historical norm:** AI research published openly

**Recent shift:** Frontier labs increasingly withhold details

**Tension:**
- Science requires openness (verification, advancement)
- Safety may require secrecy (prevent dangerous capabilities)

**Case study: AlphaGo**

```
2016: AlphaGo defeats Lee Sedol
2017: Paper published with architecture details
2018: Open-source reimplementations (ELF OpenGo, Leela Zero)

Timeline: Frontier → Open-source in ~2 years
```

**Trend:** As capabilities become more dangerous, publication slows - but can't stop entirely without harming research

### 2. Model Weights Release

**Mechanism:** Direct release of trained models

**Categories:**

**Fully open:**
- LLaMA (Meta), Mistral, Stable Diffusion
- Anyone can download and run
- Can be fine-tuned for any purpose

**Gated:**
- Some access restrictions (researcher approval)
- Terms of service limitations
- Limited enforcement

**API-only:**
- GPT-4, Claude, Gemini Advanced
- Capabilities accessible but weights controlled
- Can be distilled/reverse-engineered

**Closed:**
- Internal-only models
- Government/military AI
- Increasingly rare as competition pressures release

### 3. Distillation and Reverse Engineering

**Mechanism:** Recreate model from API access

**Process:**
```
1. Query frontier model with inputs
2. Collect outputs
3. Train smaller model to mimic behavior
4. Result: "Distilled" model with similar capabilities
```

**Effectiveness:**
- Can achieve 80-95% of original capability
- Much cheaper than training from scratch
- Defeats API-only protection strategy

**Example:** Multiple teams have distilled GPT-4 to create smaller, open models approaching its performance

**Implication:** Even closed models proliferate through distillation

### 4. Algorithmic Diffusion

**Mechanism:** Key insights enable independent development

**Examples:**
- Transformer architecture (2017) → Enabled GPT, BERT, etc.
- Diffusion models (2015-2020) → Enabled DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney
- Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (2017-2020) → Enabled ChatGPT, Claude, etc.

**Timeline:** Algorithmic breakthrough → Widespread adoption: 2-5 years

**Trend:** Accelerating as AI research community grows

### 5. Talent Mobility

**Mechanism:** Researchers move between organizations carrying knowledge

**Dynamics:**
- Frontier lab trains researcher
- Researcher joins competitor/startup/nation
- Brings tacit knowledge, insights, approaches

**Frequency:**
- High mobility in AI field
- Signing bonuses $500k-$5M for top talent
- Acqui-hires common

**Governance challenge:** Knowledge in minds can't be controlled (unlike nuclear material)

### 6. Compute Cost Decline

**Mechanism:** Cheaper compute enables broader access

**Trend:**
```
Cost per FLOP:
1960: $1,000,000
1980: $10,000
2000: $10
2020: $0.001
2024: $0.0001

Decreasing ~50% every 2 years
```

**Implication:**
- What cost $100M to train in 2022 might cost $10M in 2026
- Broadens set of actors who can afford frontier training
- Open-source can more easily match proprietary

### 7. Infrastructure Proliferation

**Mechanism:** Cloud compute makes capabilities accessible

**Current:**
- AWS, Azure, GCP provide AI infrastructure globally
- Training runs rentable (though largest labs buy/build)
- Inference extremely cheap

**Future:**
- Potential compute restrictions (export controls, licensing)
- But enforcement difficult for cloud services

## Actor Categories

### Tier 1: Frontier Labs (3-5 organizations)

**Capabilities:**
- Largest models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, Gemini Advanced)
- $100M-1B+ training budgets
- 10,000-100,000 GPUs

**Examples:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta

**Proliferation role:** Source of cutting-edge capabilities

### Tier 2: Well-Funded Followers (10-20 organizations)

**Capabilities:**
- Models 6-18 months behind frontier
- $10M-100M training budgets
- 1,000-10,000 GPUs

**Examples:** Mistral, Cohere, Inflection, xAI, Character.AI

**Proliferation role:** Rapid diffusion from Tier 1

### Tier 3: Open-Source Community (100s of projects)

**Capabilities:**
- Models 12-24 months behind frontier
- Creative efficiency, fine-tuning
- Distributed compute

**Examples:** EleutherAI, Stability AI, Hugging Face ecosystem

**Proliferation role:** Democratization, removes barriers

### Tier 4: Nation-States (5-10 countries)

**Capabilities:**
- Variable (China competitive, others lagging)
- Massive potential resources
- Different objectives (military, control)

**Examples:** China (Baidu, Alibaba), Russia, Israel, UK, France

**Proliferation role:** Geopolitical diffusion, parallel development

### Tier 5: Smaller Actors (potentially thousands)

**Capabilities:**
- Access via APIs or open-source
- Fine-tuning for specific purposes
- Limited resources but growing

**Examples:** Startups, universities, individuals, potentially malicious actors

**Proliferation role:** Widest diffusion, misuse potential

## Diffusion Timescales

### Empirical Data (2020-2024)

| Capability Level | Frontier → Tier 2 | Frontier → Open-Source | Frontier → Tier 5 |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| GPT-3 level | 6-12 months | 18-24 months | 24-36 months |
| GPT-4 level | 12-18 months | 24-36 months | 36-48 months |
| Multimodal | 6-12 months | 12-24 months | 18-30 months |
| Coding agents | 3-6 months | 12-18 months | 18-24 months |

**Trend:** Diffusion times are **shortening**

**Projection (2025-2030):**
- Frontier → Tier 2: 3-9 months
- Frontier → Open-source: 12-24 months
- Frontier → Tier 5: 18-30 months

### Critical Capability Thresholds

**Concern:** Some capabilities may be dangerous if widely proliferated

**Examples:**
- Bioweapon design assistance
- Cyberattack automation
- Advanced persuasion/manipulation
- Autonomous weapons planning
- Chemical weapon synthesis

**Current state:** Frontier models have guardrails, but:
- Jailbreaks exist
- Open-source has no guardrails
- Fine-tuning can remove safety training

**Timeline concern:**
- Dangerous capability developed: Year X
- Open-source equivalent: Year X+2
- Widely accessible: Year X+3
- Governance response: Year X+5?

**Gap:** Proliferation faster than governance

## Control Mechanisms

### 1. Compute Governance

**Approach:** Control bottleneck resource

**Mechanisms:**
- Export controls on advanced chips (current US policy)
- Licensing for large training runs
- Monitoring via chip-level tracking

**Pros:**
- Compute is physical, can be controlled
- Already implemented (NVIDIA H100 export restrictions to China)
- Affects training new models

**Cons:**
- Doesn't prevent algorithmic improvements (do more with less)
- Doesn't prevent diffusion of already-trained models
- Enforcement gaps (cloud providers, smuggling)
- Time-limited (compute gets cheaper)

**Effectiveness:** High for near-term (5 years), declining over time

### 2. Know-Your-Customer (KYC) for AI

**Approach:** Require identity verification for access

**Mechanisms:**
- API access requires verified identity
- Terms of service with use restrictions
- Monitoring for misuse patterns

**Pros:**
- Relatively easy to implement
- Increases friction for bad actors
- Enables attribution

**Cons:**
- Doesn't prevent open-source access
- Privacy concerns
- Circumventable (fake IDs, VPNs)

**Effectiveness:** Low-moderate, better than nothing

### 3. Responsible Disclosure

**Approach:** Delay publication of dangerous capabilities

**Mechanisms:**
- Frontier labs assess risks before release
- Stagger publication vs. deployment
- Coordinate with governments

**Pros:**
- Buys time for countermeasures
- Doesn't stifle all research

**Cons:**
- Voluntary, unenforceable
- Competitive pressure to publish
- Independent discovery possible

**Effectiveness:** Moderate, only works with coordination

### 4. Differential Technology Development

**Approach:** Accelerate defensive tech, slow offensive

**Mechanisms:**
- Prioritize safety research
- Develop AI-powered defenses (e.g., biosecurity screening)
- Slow proliferation of dangerous capabilities

**Pros:**
- Addresses root asymmetry (offense easier than defense)
- Compatible with continued progress

**Cons:**
- Hard to categorize offense vs. defense
- May not be technically feasible
- Requires coordination

**Effectiveness:** Unclear, promising approach

### 5. International Agreements

**Approach:** Treaties limiting proliferation

**Mechanisms:**
- Export controls (current)
- Non-proliferation treaty (proposed)
- Verification regimes

**Pros:**
- Precedent from nuclear non-proliferation
- Could enforce compute restrictions globally

**Cons:**
- Difficult to verify AI capabilities (unlike nuclear)
- Requires buy-in from competitors (China, Russia)
- Enforcement challenges

**Effectiveness:** Potentially high if achieved, but difficult

## Offense-Defense Balance

**Critical question:** Does proliferation favor offense or defense?

### Offense Advantages

**Asymmetry:**
- One successful attack can cause large harm
- Attackers can specialize in circumventing defenses
- Proliferation gives attackers more tools

**Examples:**
- Cyberattacks: One zero-day exploit can compromise millions
- Bioweapons: One successful synthesis can release pandemic
- Manipulation: One effective campaign can swing election

**Implication:** Wide proliferation increases total risk

### Defense Advantages

**Possibility:**
- Defenders can use same AI for detection, prevention
- Proliferation enables more defensive research
- Transparency about capabilities allows countermeasures

**Examples:**
- AI-powered cybersecurity
- AI-assisted biosurveillance
- AI fact-checking and deepfake detection

**Implication:** Proliferation might enable better defenses

### Empirical Evidence

**Current (2024):** Slight offense advantage

- Cyberattacks increasingly automated
- Deepfakes outpacing detection
- Jailbreaks defeating safety measures

**Projection:** Depends on investment and priorities

**Risk:** If offense advantage persists or grows, proliferation is more dangerous

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Controlled Proliferation (20% probability)

**Characteristics:**
- Frontier capabilities remain with responsible actors
- Compute governance effective
- International agreements succeed
- Dangerous capabilities don't go open-source

**Path:**
- Strong export controls
- Lab coordination on sensitive releases
- Defensive tech keeps pace
- Regulation before catastrophe

**Outcome:** Manageable risk landscape

**Challenge:** Requires unprecedented coordination

### Scenario 2: Gradual Diffusion (45% probability)

**Characteristics:**
- Capabilities spread to open-source in 2-3 years
- Some governance (partial compute restrictions)
- Mix of responsible and irresponsible actors
- Incremental adaptation

**Path:**
- Current trajectory continues
- Patchwork regulations
- Some incidents but not catastrophic
- Defensive tech development continues

**Outcome:** Elevated risk but civilization adapts

**Parallel:** Current cybersecurity landscape

### Scenario 3: Rapid Open Proliferation (25% probability)

**Characteristics:**
- Frontier capabilities quickly open-sourced
- Minimal governance
- Very wide access including bad actors
- Offense advantage persists

**Path:**
- Competitive pressure forces openness
- Compute governance fails
- No international coordination
- Algorithmic efficiency increases

**Outcome:** High risk environment, potential catastrophic events

**Parallel:** Internet in 1990s (minimal governance)

### Scenario 4: Fragmentation (10% probability)

**Characteristics:**
- Geopolitical blocs develop separate AI ecosystems
- Capabilities don't cross borders
- Internal proliferation but not global

**Path:**
- US-China tech decoupling deepens
- EU develops separate capabilities
- Export controls strictly enforced
- Internet fragments (splinternet)

**Outcome:** Reduced global proliferation but competitive dynamics persist

**Parallel:** Cold War technology separation

## Game-Theoretic Dynamics

### Proliferation Dilemma

Similar to prisoner's dilemma:

| | Others Open-Source | Others Restrict |
|---|---|---|
| **You Open-Source** | Wide access, high risk | You fall behind |
| **You Restrict** | Competitive disadvantage | Controlled risk |

**Dominant strategy:** Open-source (if others do)

**Collective optimum:** All restrict

**Result:** Tendency toward proliferation even if all prefer restriction

### First-Mover Disadvantage

Unlike racing (where first-mover wins), in proliferation:

**First to open-source:**
- Takes blame for risks
- Enables competitors
- Minimal competitive advantage (others will follow)

**Result:** Wait for others to open-source first

**But:** Eventually someone does (competitive pressure, ideological commitment, accident)

## Intervention Strategies

### High Leverage

**1. Compute Governance (Effectiveness: High, near-term)**

- Physical bottleneck
- Already implemented partially
- Can buy 5-10 years

**2. Coordinated Restraint (Effectiveness: High, if achieved)**

- Frontier labs agree on restrictions
- Verifiable commitments
- Mutual benefit

**Challenge:** Enforcement, free-riders

**3. Defensive Technology Investment (Effectiveness: Moderate-High)**

- Shift offense-defense balance
- Reduces risk of proliferation
- Dual-use benefits

### Moderate Leverage

**4. Responsible Disclosure Norms (Effectiveness: Moderate)**

- Delay most dangerous releases
- Coordination on assessments
- Time for countermeasures

**5. KYC and Monitoring (Effectiveness: Moderate)**

- Increases friction
- Enables attribution
- Deters casual misuse

### Low Leverage

**6. Education and Norms (Effectiveness: Low)**

- Awareness of risks
- Professional ethics
- Voluntary restraint

**Limited by:** Competitive pressure, bad actors ignore norms

## Critical Unknowns

### Technical Questions

1. **How fast will algorithmic efficiency improve?**
   - If rapid: Compute governance ineffective
   - If slow: Compute governance buys more time

2. **Can safety be baked in?**
   - If yes: Proliferation less risky
   - If no: Need containment

3. **Is offense-defense balance fixed?**
   - If favors defense: Proliferation tolerable
   - If favors offense: Proliferation catastrophic

### Strategic Questions

1. **Will China cooperate?**
   - Yes: Global governance possible
   - No: Fragmentation or race to bottom

2. **Can labs coordinate?**
   - Yes: Responsible proliferation possible
   - No: Competitive proliferation inevitable

3. **What triggers governance?**
   - Proactive: Before catastrophe
   - Reactive: After incident(s)

### Value Questions

1. **Is open-source inherently good?**
   - Transparency, democratization vs. safety, control
   - Depends on capabilities and risks

2. **Who should control powerful AI?**
   - Democratic legitimacy vs. technical competence
   - Private vs. public governance

## Model Limitations

### Simplifications

1. **Treats AI as homogeneous:** But different capabilities have different risks
2. **Linear diffusion:** Reality has jumps, delays, surprises
3. **Rational actors:** Ideological commitments, errors matter
4. **Static landscape:** Technology and norms evolve

### Missing Factors

1. **Unexpected breakthroughs:** Could accelerate or decelerate diffusion
2. **Social resistance:** Public backlash could slow proliferation
3. **Economic shifts:** Costs might not decline as expected
4. **Black swans:** Catastrophic event could change all dynamics

## Policy Implications

### For AI Labs

1. **Assess proliferation risk** before release decisions
2. **Coordinate with others** on sensitive capabilities
3. **Invest in defensive tech** to shift offense-defense balance
4. **Support governance** that enables responsible competition

### For Governments

1. **Implement compute governance** while still effective
2. **International coordination** is essential
3. **Invest in defenses** (biosecurity, cybersecurity, etc.)
4. **Prepare for proliferation** - assume it will happen, plan accordingly

### For Research Community

1. **Responsible disclosure** for dangerous capabilities
2. **Prioritize defensive research**
3. **Transparency about risks** to enable informed policy
4. **Avoid naive openness** - not all research should be published immediately

## Open Questions

1. **Can proliferation be prevented or only delayed?** Fundamental question
2. **What's the right balance between openness and safety?** No clear answer
3. **Will offense-defense balance favor defense?** Empirical question
4. **Can governance adapt fast enough?** Speed matters critically
5. **What happens when AGI-level capabilities proliferate?** Unprecedented scenario
