## Overview

This model projects when AI systems will be capable of conducting complete cyber attack campaigns with minimal or no human involvement. We define "autonomous cyber attack" as an AI system that can:

1. Identify targets and vulnerabilities
2. Develop or adapt exploits
3. Execute attacks
4. Adapt to defenses in real-time
5. Achieve attacker-specified objectives
6. Operate persistently over extended campaigns

**Key Question:** When does AI cross the threshold from "assistant" to "autonomous attacker"?

## The Autonomy Spectrum

Cyber attacks exist on a spectrum from fully human-directed to fully autonomous:

### Level 0: Human-Driven (Traditional)
- Humans perform all stages
- Tools assist but don't make decisions
- **Timeline:** Pre-2020 baseline

### Level 1: AI-Assisted (Current)
- AI suggests vulnerabilities or exploits
- Humans select targets and make key decisions
- AI accelerates specific tasks
- **Timeline:** 2020-2024 (current state)

### Level 2: AI-Supervised
- AI conducts reconnaissance and initial exploitation
- Humans approve major actions
- AI operates within defined parameters
- **Timeline:** 2024-2026 (emerging)

### Level 3: Semi-Autonomous
- AI conducts full attack chains
- Humans set high-level objectives
- AI adapts tactics without approval
- **Timeline:** 2025-2027 (early examples exist)

### Level 4: Fully Autonomous
- AI identifies targets based on strategic goals
- End-to-end attack execution
- Long-term persistent presence
- Self-improving capabilities
- **Timeline:** 2027-2030 (projected)

### Level 5: Superintelligent Cyber Operations
- AI discovers novel vulnerability classes
- Creates fundamentally new attack methods
- Operates at scale across global infrastructure
- Potentially undefendable by human-level defenders
- **Timeline:** Unknown, possibly never

## Current State Assessment (2025)

### Documented Capabilities

**September 2025: First Autonomous Campaign**
Anthropic documented what they assessed as the first large-scale AI-orchestrated cyberattack with minimal human intervention:
- ~30 targets (tech companies, financial institutions, governments)
- Chinese state-sponsored attribution
- "Agentic" AI capabilities executing attack chains
- Milestone: **Level 3** achieved

**Academic Demonstrations**
Multiple research teams have demonstrated AI systems that can:
- Discover and exploit vulnerabilities in controlled environments
- Navigate network defenses autonomously
- Adapt to countermeasures in real-time
- Maintain persistence without human guidance

**Commercial Offensive Tools**
Security testing tools incorporating increasingly autonomous features:
- Automated penetration testing (Pentera, Cymulate)
- Vulnerability exploitation frameworks with AI
- Attack simulation systems

**Current Assessment:** We are at **Level 2-3** transition. Semi-autonomous attacks are emerging but not yet widespread.

## Capability Requirements Analysis

For true Level 4 autonomy, AI systems need:

### 1. Reconnaissance & Target Selection
**Current Status:** High capability (80% autonomous)
- AI can scan networks, enumerate services, identify valuable targets
- Pattern recognition identifies vulnerable systems
- **Gap:** Strategic target prioritization based on complex objectives

### 2. Vulnerability Discovery
**Current Status:** Medium-High capability (60% autonomous)
- AI-assisted fuzzing and code analysis effective
- Novel vulnerability discovery improving
- **Gap:** Discovering novel vulnerability classes (not just instances)

### 3. Exploit Development
**Current Status:** Medium capability (50% autonomous)
- AI can generate exploits for known vulnerability types
- Adaptation to system variations
- **Gap:** Creating exploits for truly novel vulnerabilities

### 4. Defense Evasion
**Current Status:** Medium capability (50% autonomous)
- AI can modify malware to evade signature detection
- Some polymorphic behavior
- **Gap:** Evading behavioral analysis and AI-powered defenses

### 5. Lateral Movement
**Current Status:** Medium-Low capability (40% autonomous)
- Basic network traversal
- Credential harvesting
- **Gap:** Sophisticated persistence and stealth

### 6. Objective Achievement
**Current Status:** Low capability (30% autonomous)
- Can extract data or deploy payloads
- **Gap:** Complex multi-stage objectives, understanding strategic context

### 7. Long-Term Operation
**Current Status:** Low capability (30% autonomous)
- Limited ability to maintain persistent presence
- **Gap:** Adapting to defender responses over weeks/months

**Overall Assessment:** Current AI is ~50% of the way to Level 4 full autonomy.

## Timeline Projections

### Conservative Scenario: Slow Progress

**2026:** Level 3 becomes common
- Semi-autonomous attacks used by sophisticated state actors

## Critical Bottlenecks

What could delay full autonomy?

### Technical Bottlenecks

**1. Strategic Understanding**
AI still struggles with complex, context-dependent strategic decisions. Knowing *what* to attack and *why* requires nuance current systems lack.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay Level 4 by 2-3 years

**2. Adaptive Defense**
If defensive AI advances as fast as offensive, autonomous attacks may be contained before completing objectives.

**Estimated Impact:** May cap success rates rather than prevent capability

**3. Long-Term Persistence**
Maintaining undetected presence over months is highly sophisticated. Current AI has limited ability to "think" long-term.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay Level 4 by 1-2 years

### Regulatory Bottlenecks

**1. International Agreements**
If major powers agree to limit autonomous cyber weapons, development could slow.

**Estimated Impact:** Could delay by 2-4 years if comprehensive

**Likelihood:** Low (as of 2025, no serious proposals)

**2. Dual-Use Restrictions**
Many offensive AI capabilities are dual-use (security testing). Hard to restrict without harming defense.

**Estimated Impact:** Minimal

**3. Corporate Self-Regulation**
AI labs might refuse to develop offensive capabilities.

**Estimated Impact:** Minimal (state programs would continue)

## Indicators to Watch

- Window for international norms
- Managed transition feasible

**Recommended Actions:**
- Accelerate defensive AI deployment
- Establish attribution mechanisms
- Develop offensive/defensive AI treaties
- Build resilient infrastructure

### If Level 4 Delayed Beyond 2030 (Conservative Scenario)

**Lower Risk:**
- Defense keeps pace
- Regulatory frameworks mature
- Norms established before widespread deployment

**Recommended Actions:**
- Maintain defensive AI investment
- Use time window for international agreements
- Develop robust attribution and deterrence

## Model Limitations

1. **Assumes Continuous Progress:** AI development could plateau or face unexpected barriers

2. **Linear Extrapolation Risk:** Capabilities might advance in jumps rather than smoothly

3. **Ignores Wild Cards:** Quantum computing, novel AI architectures could accelerate or change trajectory

4. **State vs. Criminal Actors:** Model primarily considers state-level capabilities; criminal diffusion may differ

5. **Defense Co-Evolution:** Defensive capabilities are modeled separately but deeply affect offensive success

## Key Debates

**Is Full Autonomy Even Desirable?** Even if technically feasible, will actors deploy fully autonomous attacks given risk of unintended escalation?

**Can Humans Meaningfully Remain in the Loop?** If attacks operate at machine speed, human oversight may be illusory.

**Will Defense Autonomy Match Offense?** Autonomous attacks may force autonomous defense, creating escalatory dynamics.
