## Overview

Racing dynamics in AI development can be understood through the lens of an iterated prisoner's dilemma with asymmetric payoffs and time-varying parameters. The core insight is that individual rationality produces collectively suboptimal outcomes when safety investments reduce competitive advantage. Each major AI developer faces a structural tension: safety work requires time and resources that slow deployment, but first-mover advantages in capabilities—talent attraction, data access, revenue, and strategic positioning—create intense pressure to move fast. This produces a classic collective action problem where rational choices by individual actors generate irrational outcomes for the group as a whole.

The central tension arises because safety work takes time and resources. In a competitive environment, the first actor to deploy captures disproportionate rewards including market dominance, talent acquisition, data network effects, and influence over emerging standards. This creates pressure to skimp on safety even when all actors would prefer a slower, safer trajectory. The 2023-2024 period has illustrated these dynamics clearly: despite public commitments to responsible development, labs have accelerated release schedules in response to competitive pressure, with safety evaluation timelines reportedly compressed under commercial urgency.

**Central Question:** Under what conditions can AI developers escape the racing equilibrium, and which interventions most effectively shift the payoff structure toward cooperative safety investment?

## Conceptual Framework

### Game Structure

The racing dynamics model treats AI development as a multi-player game with continuous strategy spaces. Each player chooses a safety investment level $s \in [0,1]$ and deployment speed $v \in [0,1]$, facing a fundamental tradeoff: higher safety investment enables slower, more careful development, while lower safety investment permits faster deployment but increases catastrophic risk. The game exhibits several features that intensify competitive pressure: incomplete information about competitors' progress, first-mover advantages in deployment, and negative externalities from inadequate safety that affect all players regardless of their individual choices.

### Players and Strategies

The game involves multiple actor types with different objective functions and constraints. Leading AI laboratories—including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta AI, and emerging Chinese competitors—operate under a combination of mission-driven goals and commercial pressures. Nation-states function as regulatory and funding entities whose policies shape the competitive landscape. Potential new entrants, including well-funded startups and open-source communities, create additional competitive pressure by threatening to disrupt established positions.

Each player's strategy can be characterized along a spectrum from cautious to aggressive. A cautious strategy involves high safety investment (comprehensive red-teaming, extended evaluation periods, conservative deployment thresholds), accepting slower capability advancement as a tradeoff. An aggressive strategy prioritizes speed, compressing safety evaluations and deploying at lower confidence thresholds. Mixed strategies involve moderate investments in both dimensions, often characterized by public safety commitments combined with internal pressure to accelerate.

### Mathematical Formulation

The utility function for player $i$ competing against player $j$ captures the core tradeoffs:

$$
U_i = V(c_i, t_i) - C(s_i) - R(r_i) \times P(\text{harm} | s_i, s_j)
$$

Where the components represent:
- $V(c_i, t_i)$ = Value captured from deployment, a function of capabilities $c$ and timing $t$
- $C(s_i)$ = Direct cost of safety investment (compute, personnel, time delay)
- $R(r_i)$ = Expected harm if catastrophic risk realizes
- $P(\text{harm} | s_i, s_j)$ = Probability of catastrophic outcome given both players' safety choices

The value function $V$ exhibits two critical properties. First, it has a **first-mover bonus**: $\frac{\partial V}{\partial t_i} < 0$ when $t_i > t_j$, meaning delayed deployment relative to competitors reduces value captured. Second, it shows **winner-take-most dynamics**: the leader captures disproportionate returns, so $V(c, t_{\text{first}}) >> V(c, t_{\text{second}})$ even for similar capability levels.

The risk term $R \times P$ represents a **public bad**: harm from a catastrophic AI incident affects all players and society regardless of who caused it. This externality structure—private benefits from racing, socialized costs from accidents—is the fundamental driver of the coordination problem.

## Equilibrium Analysis

### Nash Equilibrium Under Competition

In the absence of binding coordination mechanisms, the game exhibits a dominant strategy equilibrium favoring aggressive development. Consider player $i$'s best response to player $j$'s strategy choice. If player $j$ chooses an aggressive strategy, player $i$'s best response is also aggressive: investing in safety while losing the capability race yields the costs of safety without the strategic benefits. The aggressive competitor captures first-mover advantages while the cautious player bears both direct costs and competitive disadvantage.

If player $j$ chooses a cautious strategy, player $i$'s best response remains aggressive. By defecting from cooperation, player $i$ can capture first-mover advantages at lower cost while free-riding on player $j$'s safety contributions (to the extent those reduce shared catastrophic risk). The result is a dominant strategy equilibrium at (Aggressive, Aggressive)—a classic prisoner's dilemma structure where individually rational choices produce collectively irrational outcomes.

| Player i / Player j | Cautious | Aggressive |
|---------------------|----------|------------|
| **Cautious** | (3, 3) Pareto optimal | (1, 4) Sucker's payoff |
| **Aggressive** | (4, 1) Temptation payoff | (2, 2) Nash equilibrium |

The numbers represent ordinal rankings where 4 is best and 1 is worst. The Nash equilibrium (2, 2) is Pareto-dominated by mutual cooperation (3, 3), but no player has incentive to unilaterally deviate toward caution.

### Social Optimum and Coordination Gap

The Pareto-optimal outcome is mutual caution: both players invest substantially in safety, accepting slower deployment in exchange for reduced catastrophic risk. Under this scenario, the collective benefits of capability development are shared without racing-induced risk premiums. The gap between the Nash equilibrium and social optimum represents the value destroyed by coordination failure—potentially including catastrophic outcomes that harm all players and society.

Quantifying this gap requires estimates of first-mover advantages and catastrophic risk probabilities:

| Parameter | Low Estimate | Central | High Estimate | Confidence |
|-----------|--------------|---------|---------------|------------|
| First-mover revenue advantage | 1.5x | 2.5x | 5x | Medium |
| First-mover talent advantage | 1.2x | 1.5x | 2x | Medium |
| Safety tax (cost/delay ratio) | 10% | 25% | 50% | Medium |
| P(catastrophe \| mutual aggressive) | 5% | 15% | 35% | Very Low |
| P(catastrophe \| mutual cautious) | 1% | 3% | 8% | Very Low |
| Catastrophe cost (relative to market) | 10x | 100x | 1000x | Very Low |

**Key insight:** Even small catastrophic risk probabilities, combined with large catastrophe costs, can make mutual caution the expected-value-maximizing outcome. The coordination gap exists because first-mover advantages are private and immediate while catastrophe risks are shared and deferred.

## Dynamic Elements

### Time-Varying Racing Intensity

Racing pressure is not constant but varies based on perceived proximity to critical capability thresholds, visibility of competitors' progress, and external pressure from geopolitical and commercial forces. The model predicts that racing intensity follows a characteristic pattern over the development trajectory.

<Mermaid client:load chart={`xychart-beta
    title "Racing Intensity Over Development Trajectory"

    y-axis "Racing Pressure" 0 --> 100
    bar [15, 35, 65, 95, 40]`} />

In early research phases, collaboration is relatively stable because first-mover advantages are unclear and timelines are long. During the scaling era (roughly 2020-2024), racing pressure intensifies as capability improvements become predictable and competitive positioning matters. In the pre-AGI and near-AGI phases, racing pressure maximizes as actors perceive that decisive capabilities may be imminent. Paradoxically, racing pressure may decline post-AGI if a single actor achieves decisive advantage, though this outcome itself poses severe risks.

The trigger condition for racing acceleration can be expressed as:

$$
P(\text{competitor breakthrough}) \times V(\text{first-mover advantage}) > C(\text{safety investment}) + \delta
$$

Where $\delta$ represents the risk-adjusted cost of potential catastrophe. When actors perceive high probability of competitor breakthroughs and large first-mover advantages, the inequality tips toward aggressive strategies even if safety costs are modest.

### Feedback Loops

Racing dynamics involve multiple reinforcing and balancing feedback loops that can either destabilize cooperation or provide paths back toward safety.

| Loop Type | Mechanism | Effect | Stability Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Capability-Pressure | Advanced capabilities raise stakes, intensify racing | Reinforcing | Destabilizing |
| Investment-Advantage | Early leads attract more funding, widen gap | Reinforcing | Destabilizing |
| Risk-Speed | Perceived risk of being second accelerates deployment | Reinforcing | Destabilizing |
| Incident-Regulation | Visible harms generate public pressure for constraints | Balancing | Stabilizing |
| Transparency-Trust | Information sharing reduces uncertainty, enables cooperation | Balancing | Stabilizing |
| Coordination-Norms | Successful coordination establishes precedent | Balancing | Stabilizing |

The destabilizing loops tend to operate faster than stabilizing loops: competitive pressure responses occur in weeks to months, while regulatory responses and norm establishment require years. This temporal asymmetry means that racing can accelerate rapidly while coordination mechanisms develop slowly.

## Multi-Player Extensions

### N-Player Dynamics

Extending the model beyond two players introduces additional complications that generally intensify racing pressure. With N > 2 competitors, the free-rider problem becomes more severe because each player's safety investments benefit all others. Coordination difficulty increases roughly as O(N²) due to the bilateral relationships that must be managed. First-mover advantages may strengthen in markets with network effects, as early leaders can establish standards and lock-in effects.

The probability of at least one defector—one player choosing an aggressive strategy—increases with N. If each player independently defects with probability $p$, the probability of at least one defector is $1 - (1-p)^N$, which approaches 1 as N grows even for small individual defection probabilities.

| Number of Players | P(all cooperate) @ p=0.2 | P(all cooperate) @ p=0.4 | Racing Pressure |
|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2 | 64% | 36% | Moderate |
| 3 | 51% | 22% | Elevated |
| 5 | 33% | 8% | High |
| 10 | 11% | 0.6% | Very High |
| 20 | 1% | &lt;0.01% | Extreme |

**Prediction:** As the AI development field expands to include more credible competitors, coordination becomes increasingly difficult without formal enforcement mechanisms.

### Asymmetric Player Analysis

Real-world players face different constraints and incentives that create heterogeneous racing pressures. The following table characterizes how different actor types experience the game:

| Actor Type | Time Horizon | Resource Depth | Regulatory Exposure | Risk Tolerance | Racing Pressure |
|------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Frontier labs (US) | Medium (5-10 yr) | High | High | Medium | High |
| Big Tech AI divisions | Long (10+ yr) | Very High | Very High | Low | Medium |
| Chinese national labs | Long (10+ yr) | High | Low (domestic) | Medium-High | High |
| Well-funded startups | Short (2-5 yr) | Medium | Medium | High | Very High |
| Open-source communities | Varies | Low | Low | High | Medium |
| Academic research | Long | Low | Medium | Low | Low |

Startups face the most intense racing pressure due to short time horizons, investor expectations, and existential dependence on competitive positioning. Established players with diversified businesses face lower pressure but may still race to protect strategic positions. State-backed Chinese labs face unique dynamics: lower regulatory constraint but potential diplomatic costs from safety failures.

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario Probability Assessment

| Scenario | Probability | Description | Key Conditions | Outcome for Safety |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Successful Coordination | 10-20% | Major labs establish binding safety commitments with verification | International agreement, major incident catalyst, technical verification breakthrough | Slow, safe development |
| Stable Duopoly Racing | 35-45% | US and China clusters compete with moderate intensity | Current trajectory continues, no decisive breakthroughs | Elevated risk, not catastrophic |
| Unstable Multi-Polar Racing | 25-35% | Multiple credible competitors, high uncertainty, weak coordination | Open-source proliferation, regulatory fragmentation | High catastrophic risk |
| Unipolar Sprint | 5-15% | Single actor achieves decisive lead, races to deployment | Major algorithmic or compute breakthrough | Very high risk during sprint |

The modal outcome (Stable Duopoly Racing) represents continuation of current dynamics: two major capability clusters (US-allied and Chinese) competing with sufficient mutual awareness to avoid the most extreme racing while still underinvesting in safety relative to the social optimum. This scenario produces elevated but manageable risk.

### Scenario Pathway Analysis

**Scenario 1: Successful Coordination (15% central estimate)**

The path to successful coordination most plausibly runs through a significant safety incident that shifts public and elite opinion, followed by US-China bilateral dialogue establishing mutual safety commitments, and eventually a multilateral framework with verification mechanisms. Historical precedent suggests coordination emerges after demonstrated risk (the Cuban Missile Crisis preceded arms control treaties) rather than through foresight alone. Key enablers include technical progress on verification methods, alignment of commercial and safety incentives, and sustained civil society pressure.

**Scenario 2: Stable Duopoly Racing (45% central estimate)**

The most likely scenario involves continued competition between US-aligned labs and Chinese national efforts, with racing pressure moderated by several factors: reputational costs of safety failures, regulatory uncertainty creating caution, and the genuine difficulty of achieving transformative capabilities. Safety investment remains suboptimal but not negligible. Risk accumulates gradually rather than spiking, with periodic incidents prompting temporary slowdowns but not fundamental restructuring.

**Scenario 3: Unstable Multi-Polar Racing (30% central estimate)**

This scenario emerges if open-source capabilities approach frontier performance, enabling many actors to compete credibly for advanced AI. Coordination difficulty explodes with the number of players, and the probability of at least one aggressive defector approaches certainty. Even well-intentioned actors may race defensively, believing that if powerful AI is inevitable, better for safety-conscious developers to reach it first. This scenario carries the highest catastrophic risk.

**Scenario 4: Unipolar Sprint (10% central estimate)**

A decisive breakthrough—novel algorithmic insight, unexpected compute efficiency, or classified capability—could enable one actor to pull substantially ahead. The leader faces intense temptation to press the advantage before competitors can respond, while followers attempt risky catch-up development. Historical analogy: the Manhattan Project's sprint to deployment under perceived competitive pressure. This scenario is rare but carries extreme risk during the sprint phase.

## Historical Analogies

### Nuclear Weapons Development

The nuclear arms race provides the closest historical parallel, with both illuminating similarities and crucial differences. The Manhattan Project exhibited racing dynamics: the perceived threat of Nazi nuclear weapons drove acceleration despite known risks. Post-war US-Soviet competition produced the arms race, with both sides pursuing capabilities beyond any plausible use case.

| Dimension | Nuclear Weapons | AI Development |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Trigger for racing | Perceived Nazi progress, then Soviet test | Perceived competitor capability advances |
| Verification feasibility | High (observable tests, satellite imagery) | Low (capabilities evolve continuously, hard to verify) |
| Barriers to entry | Very high (enrichment facilities, rare materials) | Medium-Low (compute, talent, data) |
| Coordination outcome | Arms control treaties after near-catastrophe | Unknown—coordination mechanisms underdeveloped |
| Risk visibility | Demonstrated (Hiroshima, near-misses) | Not yet demonstrated at scale |

**Key lesson:** Nuclear coordination emerged only after demonstrated catastrophic potential (Hiroshima/Nagasaki) and near-catastrophe (Cuban Missile Crisis). The absence of demonstrated AI catastrophe may mean coordination requires either exceptional foresight or a warning incident.

### Pharmaceutical Racing

The pharmaceutical industry offers a different template: commercial racing constrained by regulatory frameworks. Drug development involves speed-safety tradeoffs, with companies racing to market while regulators impose approval requirements. The FDA approval process creates a coordination mechanism that levels the playing field on safety while preserving competitive dynamics on innovation.

However, pharmaceutical harms are typically local and reversible—a failed drug harms recipients, not the entire population. AI risks may be global and irreversible, making the pharmaceutical model insufficient. The liability mechanisms that incentivize pharmaceutical safety (lawsuits, reputational damage) may not apply when AI harms are diffuse or attributed with difficulty.

## Intervention Analysis

### Mechanism Design Solutions

Escaping the racing equilibrium requires changing the game's payoff structure so that cooperation becomes individually rational. Three categories of intervention show promise:

**Coordination Mechanisms** reduce the information asymmetries that drive racing. Information sharing agreements—where labs disclose capability levels and safety evaluations—reduce uncertainty about competitor timelines, enabling more calibrated responses. Joint safety research converts safety from a competitive cost to shared infrastructure benefiting all parties. Deployment windows or synchronized release schedules can eliminate first-mover advantages at discrete capability thresholds.

**Regulatory Frameworks** directly modify payoffs by raising the cost of aggressive strategies. Minimum safety standards (evaluation requirements, deployment thresholds) create a floor below which no lab can compete. Licensing requirements introduce checkpoints that compress timing advantages. Liability frameworks—making developers responsible for downstream harms—internalize risk costs that the market otherwise ignores.

**Incentive Restructuring** attempts to make safety a competitive advantage rather than a tax. Safety competitions and prizes reward innovation in alignment and evaluation. Reputation markets, where long-term credibility depends on safety track records, shift the payoff matrix toward caution. Public compute access reduces the winner-take-all dynamics that drive racing intensity.

### Stability Conditions

Cooperative equilibria are sustainable when the expected payoff from continued cooperation exceeds the expected payoff from defection:

$$
V_{\text{cooperate}} > V_{\text{defect}} - P(\text{detection}) \times \text{Penalty} - P(\text{catastrophe}|\text{defect}) \times \text{Harm}
$$

This inequality holds when three conditions are met. **Verification** enables detection of defection—racing behavior that violates safety commitments. **Enforcement** provides credible penalties for detected violations, whether through regulatory action, reputational damage, or coordinated response from other players. **Iteration** enables trust-building through repeated interactions; one-shot games favor defection while repeated games can sustain cooperation through reputation and reciprocity.

| Stability Requirement | Current Status | Improvement Path | Feasibility |
|----------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Verification of safety claims | Weak—evaluations not standardized | Third-party audits, standardized benchmarks | Medium |
| Verification of capability levels | Very Weak—no disclosure norms | Structured access programs, compute monitoring | Low-Medium |
| Enforcement mechanisms | Weak—no binding agreements | Regulatory frameworks, trade coordination | Medium |
| Penalty severity | Low—reputational only | Liability expansion, license revocation | Medium-High |
| Iteration frequency | High—continuous development | Maintain through regular coordination fora | High |

## Model Limitations

### Simplifying Assumptions

The model relies on several assumptions that may not hold in practice. **Rationality** assumes players maximize expected utility, but actors under competitive pressure, ideological commitment, or organizational dysfunction may behave irrationally. **Common knowledge** assumes players understand the game structure and others' payoffs, but information asymmetries may be larger than modeled. **Unitary actors** treats labs as monolithic decision-makers, but internal disagreements between safety teams, commercial leadership, and researchers may produce inconsistent strategies. **Static payoffs** assumes fixed utility functions, but learning and adaptation continuously reshape incentives.

### Missing Elements

Several factors omitted from the model may substantially affect dynamics. **Technical uncertainty** about capability thresholds means players cannot precisely identify when racing is most dangerous. **Value heterogeneity** among players—some genuinely prioritize safety over competitive success—creates potential for leadership by example. **Black swan events**—unexpected breakthroughs, accidents, or geopolitical shifts—can rapidly restructure the game. **Cultural and ideological factors** including trust, professional norms, and organizational mission may matter beyond purely economic payoffs.

### Empirical Unknowns

Critical parameters remain highly uncertain. How large are first-mover advantages—winner-take-all or merely winner-take-more? How effective is safety investment at reducing catastrophic risk—high marginal returns or diminishing returns? Can capability verification work technically—or is the information too easy to conceal? Answers to these questions would substantially sharpen the model's predictions and intervention priorities.

## Policy Implications

### For AI Laboratories

The model suggests several strategic insights for safety-conscious labs. Voluntary commitments to safety are unstable without verification mechanisms—competitors cannot trust unilateral restraint. Safety as competitive advantage requires external support (regulatory preference, market differentiation, reputational returns) rather than pure commercial logic. Information sharing about capabilities and safety evaluations, if credible, reduces racing pressure by enabling more calibrated competitive responses. Labs should advocate for industry-wide standards that convert safety costs from competitive disadvantage to shared infrastructure.

### For Governments

International coordination is essential, not optional—purely domestic regulation creates arbitrage opportunities that undermine safety without slowing capability development. Regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions prevents racing to the bottom on safety standards. Public investment in safety research (alignment, evaluation, interpretability) creates shared infrastructure that benefits all developers while reducing private racing incentives. Export controls and compute governance can modulate racing intensity by influencing the number and resources of competitors.

### For Researchers

Technical work on verification—methods to assess model capabilities, safety properties, and development practices—directly enables coordination by making defection detectable. Safety research should generally be open-source to create shared infrastructure rather than proprietary advantages. Evaluation frameworks that standardize safety assessment enable the benchmarking necessary for regulatory enforcement.

## Open Questions

Several critical questions remain unresolved and merit further research. Can safety become a sustained competitive advantage, or does competition inevitably erode safety investments? What verification mechanisms are technically feasible for AI capabilities and safety properties? How strong are first-mover advantages in AI deployment—enough to justify catastrophic risk-taking? Can informal norms and professional ethics sustain cooperation, or are formal treaties and enforcement necessary? What role can smaller actors (startups, academics, open-source communities) play in shifting racing dynamics? How does the model change as capabilities approach and exceed human-level performance?
