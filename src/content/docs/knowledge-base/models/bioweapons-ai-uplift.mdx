## Overview

"Uplift" measures how much AI assistance increases an attacker's probability of success compared to what they could achieve without AI. This model attempts to quantify that marginal contribution.

**Key question:** Does AI meaningfully lower the barrier, or is it mostly redundant with existing information sources?

## The Uplift Framework

```
Uplift = P(success | with AI) - P(success | without AI)
       = P(success | with AI) / P(success | without AI)  [ratio version]
```

A ratio of 1.0 means no uplift. A ratio of 2.0 means AI doubles success probability.

## Information Sources Hierarchy

An attacker today has access to multiple information sources. AI must provide value beyond these:

| Source | Accessibility | Depth | Danger Level |
|--------|--------------|-------|--------------|
| Scientific literature | High | Very High | Moderate |
| Textbooks | High | High | Low-Moderate |
| Internet (surface) | Very High | Moderate | Low |
| Dark web forums | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Recruiting experts | Low | Very High | Very High |
| **Current LLMs** | Very High | Moderate-High | **?** |
| **Future LLMs** | Very High | High-Very High | **?** |

## Evidence Review

### RAND Study (2024)
**Finding:** No statistically significant difference between AI-assisted and non-AI groups in creating viable bioweapon attack plans.

**Methodology:**
- 12 teams, 80 hours each over 7 weeks
- Expert evaluation of plan viability
- Controlled comparison

**Interpretation:**
- Suggests current LLMs don't provide meaningful uplift for sophisticated planning
- May not capture uplift for non-experts
- Doesn't test actual synthesis, only planning

### Anthropic Internal Evaluations
**Finding:** Models know dangerous information but testing suggests limited practical uplift.

**Caveats:**
- Details not fully public
- Evaluations focus on their models with safety training
- Open-source models may differ

### Microsoft DNA Screening Research (2024)
**Finding:** AI-designed toxins evaded >75% of synthesis screening tools.

**Implication:** AI could provide uplift in evading biosecurity controls, even if knowledge itself isn't novel.

## Uplift by Actor Type

### Non-Expert Individual
- **Baseline capability:** Very low
- **AI contribution:** Could be significant for knowledge acquisition
- **Net probability:** Still very low (wet lab barrier remains)
- **Estimated uplift ratio:** 2-5x on knowledge step, ~1.5x overall

### Expert Scientist (Corrupt)
- **Baseline capability:** Moderate-high
- **AI contribution:** Marginal—they already know the science
- **Net probability:** Moderate
- **Estimated uplift ratio:** 1.0-1.3x

### Terrorist Organization
- **Baseline capability:** Low-moderate
- **AI contribution:** Could help with planning, acquisition
- **Net probability:** Low
- **Estimated uplift ratio:** 1.5-3x

### State Program
- **Baseline capability:** High
- **AI contribution:** Potentially significant for novel agents
- **Net probability:** Moderate-high
- **Estimated uplift ratio:** 1.2-2x for novel approaches

## Decomposing Uplift by Task

| Task | Current AI Uplift | Future AI Uplift (est.) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Target identification | Low (1.1x) | Moderate (2x) |
| Synthesis planning | Low (1.2x) | Moderate-High (3x) |
| Acquisition guidance | Low (1.1x) | Low-Moderate (1.5x) |
| Protocol optimization | Low (1.3x) | High (4x) |
| Evading detection | Moderate (2x) | High (5x) |
| Deployment planning | Low (1.1x) | Moderate (2x) |

**Key observation:** The highest uplift may be in evading biosecurity measures rather than in core synthesis knowledge.

## The Biological Design Tool (BDT) Factor

Current analysis focuses on LLMs (text-based). The combination of:
- LLMs for knowledge
- Protein structure prediction (AlphaFold)
- Generative biological models
- Automated lab systems

Could create a "capability stack" with higher aggregate uplift than any component alone.

**This is understudied and concerning.**

## Time Dynamics

Uplift is not static. Key trends:

| Factor | Direction | Impact on Uplift |
|--------|-----------|------------------|
| Model capabilities | Increasing | ↑ |
| Open-source availability | Increasing | ↑ |
| Biosecurity measures | Improving | ↓ |
| DNA synthesis screening | Improving | ↓ |
| Wet lab automation | Increasing | ↑ |

## Model Summary

### Current State (2024-2025)
- **Knowledge uplift:** 1.2-2x for non-experts
- **Overall attack success uplift:** 1.1-1.5x
- **Confidence:** Medium—limited empirical data

### Near Future (2026-2028)
- **Knowledge uplift:** 2-4x for non-experts
- **Overall attack success uplift:** 1.5-3x
- **Confidence:** Low—significant uncertainty

### Key Uncertainties
1. How much do wet lab barriers matter long-term?
2. Will BDT + LLM combinations be transformative?
3. How fast will biosecurity adapt?

## Policy Implications

If current uplift is low:
- Focus resources on maintaining low uplift
- Strengthen biosecurity broadly
- Monitor for capability jumps

If current uplift is underestimated:
- Urgent need for LLM guardrails
- Restrict open-source biology models
- Prepare for attacks

**Both approaches suggest investing in biosecurity countermeasures, regardless of AI-specific measures.**
