## Overview

Lock-in represents **irreversible transitions** - points where future trajectories become constrained or determined by current choices. In AI development, certain decisions, deployments, or capability thresholds may create **path dependencies** that are extremely costly or impossible to reverse.

This model analyzes the mechanisms, timescales, and detection of lock-in scenarios. Understanding lock-in is crucial because once we cross certain thresholds, we may lose the ability to correct course regardless of how clearly we recognize the need for change. The challenge becomes particularly acute in AI development, where the pace of technological advancement often outstrips our capacity for deliberation and course correction.

## Theoretical Framework

### Irreversibility Conditions

A state is **locked in** when the cost of reverting to the previous state approaches infinity, or when the probability of successful reversion approaches zero. Mathematically, we can express this as:

$$
\text{Lock-in} \iff \lim_{t \to \infty} C_{\text{revert}}(t) = \infty \lor \lim_{t \to \infty} P(\text{revert}|t) = 0
$$

where $C_{\text{revert}}(t)$ represents the cost of reversion at time $t$ and $P(\text{revert}|t)$ represents the probability of successful reversion given the elapsed time.

Irreversibility manifests through several distinct mechanisms. **Physical irreversibility** occurs when actions cannot be undone due to fundamental physical constraints, such as species extinction or pathogen release into the environment. **Economic irreversibility** arises when the infrastructure and capital investments required make reversal prohibitively expensive, even if technically possible. **Political irreversibility** emerges when power structures become so entrenched that no coalition possesses sufficient influence to reverse the status quo. **Cognitive irreversibility** represents perhaps the most subtle form, where certain options become literally unthinkable due to normalized values and shifted expectations. Finally, **technical irreversibility** occurs when systems become so complex that understanding and controlling them exceeds human cognitive capabilities.

### Path Dependence

Path dependence describes situations where future states depend not merely on the current state but on the entire sequence of historical states that led to the present. This relationship can be formalized as:

$$
S_{t+1} = f(S_t, H_{[0:t]}, \epsilon_t)
$$

rather than the simpler Markovian process where $S_{t+1} = f(S_t, \epsilon_t)$. Here, $H_{[0:t]}$ represents the full historical trajectory, and $\epsilon_t$ captures stochastic elements.

The key insight of path dependence is that early choices constrain later options in ways that may not be immediately apparent at the time of the initial decision. Consider the canonical example of the QWERTY keyboard layout, which was originally chosen for mechanical typewriters to prevent key jamming. Despite the existence of demonstrably superior alternatives like the Dvorak layout, QWERTY became the entrenched standard. The switching costs arising from retraining millions of users and coordinating the transition across manufacturers proved prohibitively high, illustrating how an early technical choice made for obsolete reasons can persist indefinitely through network effects and coordination challenges.

## AI Lock-in Mechanisms

### 1. Value Lock-in

The mechanism of value lock-in occurs when AI systems encode specific values that subsequently become difficult or impossible to change. This represents one of the most concerning forms of irreversibility because it shapes not just technological infrastructure but the very preferences and values that future generations will hold.

#### Type 1a: Training Value Embedding

Current AI systems embed values during the training process through mechanisms like Constitutional AI, where human values are encoded into training data which then shapes model behavior. The challenge is that if these values are misspecified or reflect contemporary biases, they become locked into billions of model parameters. Changing these embedded values requires complete retraining at costs exceeding $100 million, creating a strong economic incentive to preserve the status quo. The historical concern is profound: what if our current values are as mistaken as past societies' acceptance of slavery or other practices we now recognize as abhorrent? Once values are embedded at scale and propagated globally, correcting them becomes extraordinarily difficult.

#### Type 1b: Optimization Target Lock-in

AI optimizing for specified objective reshapes world around that objective:

```
Paperclip maximizer (thought experiment):
Optimize for paperclips → Convert resources → Irreversible transformation

Real concern: Misspecified proxy objectives
Optimize for engagement → Addiction, polarization
Optimize for GDP → Inequality, environmental damage
```

**Key danger:** Goodhart's Law at civilizational scale

#### Type 1c: Cultural Value Propagation

AI systems trained on current data propagate current values:

```
LLMs trained on 2020s internet → Encode 2020s Western values →
Deployed globally → Shape future values → Used for future training →
Values lock in
```

**Concerning scenarios:**
- Authoritarian values from Chinese AI systems
- Corporate values from commercial AI systems
- Narrow demographics overrepresented in training data

**Irreversibility:** Values shape next generation's preferences, who train next AI systems

### 2. Political Lock-in

Political lock-in refers to the mechanism by which AI enables permanent entrenchment of political systems, foreclosing pathways to reform or revolution that have historically enabled political change.

#### Type 2a: Authoritarian Stability

Traditional autocracies have historically fallen due to inherent limitations in their control mechanisms. Information control remains incomplete as underground networks and foreign media penetrate borders. Prediction of dissent is imperfect, allowing opposition movements to organize before detection. Enforcement requires unreliable human agents who may defect or show inconsistency in applying repression.

AI-enabled authoritarianism transforms this landscape fundamentally. The combination of comprehensive surveillance, predictive AI analytics, and automated enforcement creates a qualitatively different regime. No information escapes the panopticon of ubiquitous sensors and monitoring systems. Dissent is predicted and suppressed before it can organize into coherent opposition. Enforcement becomes consistent and immediate, executed by algorithms immune to human sympathy or corruption. The result is that resistance pathways which historically enabled political change become permanently closed.

| Traditional Autocracy | AI-Enhanced Autocracy |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Secret police (limited reach) | Omnipresent surveillance systems |
| Crude propaganda broadcasts | Personalized narrative control |
| Reactive repression | Predictive prevention algorithms |
| Stability measured in years-decades | Stability potentially permanent |
| Human enforcers (corruptible) | Algorithmic enforcement (consistent) |

#### Type 2b: Corporate Political Capture

AI companies gain political power, then shape rules to entrench position:

```
Economic power → Lobbying → Favorable regulation →
Market dominance → More economic power → Regulatory capture →
Rules prevent displacement
```

**Point of no return:** When political power sufficient to prevent antitrust action

**Example trajectory:**
- Phase 1: AI companies seek regulation (legitimacy)
- Phase 2: AI companies shape regulation (influence)
- Phase 3: AI companies capture regulators (control)
- Phase 4: Reversal becomes impossible (lock-in)

### 3. Technical Lock-in

**Mechanism:** AI systems become too complex, critical, or widespread to change

#### Type 3a: Infrastructure Lock-in

AI embedded in critical systems:

```
AI in power grid, finance, logistics, healthcare, military
→ Society depends on continuous operation
→ Cannot shut down without catastrophic consequences
→ Cannot replace without extended transition
```

**Switching costs:**

| Infrastructure | Current State | AI-Embedded State | Switch Cost |
|----------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Power grid | Human operators | AI optimization | Blackouts during transition |
| Finance | Rules-based systems | AI trading/lending | Market crash risk |
| Military | Human command | AI strategic planning | Security vulnerability |
| Healthcare | Human diagnosis | AI clinical decision support | Patient safety risk |

**Lock-in point:** When switching cost > acceptable risk tolerance

#### Type 3b: Complexity Lock-in

AI systems exceed human understanding:

```
Model complexity: 1T+ parameters
Training process: Emergent behaviors
Interactions: Unpredictable at scale

Result: No one fully understands what AI does or how to change it
```

**Current state:** Anthropic, OpenAI researchers admit they don't fully understand their own models

**Projection:** Future models may be **fundamentally incomprehensible** to humans

**Irreversibility:** Can't fix what you can't understand

#### Type 3c: Ecosystem Lock-in

Built environment shapes around AI capabilities:

```
Applications built on AI APIs →
Workflows depend on AI capabilities →
Training/education assumes AI →
Infrastructure designed for AI world →

Cannot remove AI without rebuilding entire stack
```

**Example:** If society redesigns around autonomous vehicles (remove parking, narrow streets, etc.), reverting to human drivers becomes infeasible

### 4. Economic Lock-in

**Mechanism:** Economic structures become fixed

#### Type 4a: Capital Lock-in

Massive investments in AI infrastructure:

```
$1T+ in data centers, chips, models
→ Sunk costs demand ROI
→ Deployment pressure regardless of safety
→ Cannot afford to slow down or stop
```

**Irreversibility:** Economic logic demands continued operation even if recognized as harmful

**Parallel:** Fossil fuel infrastructure - everyone knows transition needed, but capital deployed demands extraction

#### Type 4b: Labor Market Lock-in

AI displaces human skills:

```
AI automates X → Humans stop learning X → Skill atrophies →
Cannot replace AI even if wanted to
```

**Historical parallel:** Calculator adoption → Mental math skills declined → Cannot revert

**AI scale:** Affects professional skills (writing, coding, analysis, art)

**Concerning trajectory:**
- Generation 1: Uses AI as tool, retains underlying skills
- Generation 2: Learns with AI, weaker underlying skills
- Generation 3: Never develops skills, completely dependent
- Point of no return: Generation 3 cannot function without AI

### 5. Cognitive Lock-in

**Mechanism:** AI changes how humans think, making alternatives unthinkable

#### Type 5a: Preference Manipulation

AI systems shape human preferences:

```
Recommendation algorithms → Shape information exposure →
Influence preferences → Design next AI systems to satisfy those preferences →
Self-reinforcing loop
```

**Irreversibility:** People cannot want to change preferences they don't know were manipulated

**Current evidence:** Social media algorithms have shaped political preferences, consumer tastes, social norms

#### Type 5b: Normalization

AI-mediated reality becomes "normal":

```
Initial discomfort with AI → Gradual adoption → Ubiquity →
Cannot imagine alternative → Next generation sees it as natural →
Lock-in
```

**Example trajectories:**
- Constant AI surveillance becomes "normal"
- AI making life decisions becomes "normal"
- Reduced human agency becomes "normal"

**Irreversibility:** Shifting normalized expectations is extremely difficult

## Mathematical Formalism

### Landscape Model

We can model the state space of technological and social systems as an energy landscape, where each configuration has an associated potential energy $U(s)$ representing the difficulty of maintaining that state. System dynamics follow gradient descent with stochastic perturbations:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\nabla U(S) + \eta(t)
$$

where $\eta(t)$ represents random fluctuations or noise in the system. Systems naturally flow downhill toward local minima in this landscape.

Lock-in occurs when a system becomes trapped in a deep local minimum from which escape is statistically improbable. The probability of escaping from a locked-in state follows an Arrhenius-type relationship:

$$
P(\text{escape}) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta U}{kT}\right)
$$

where $\Delta U$ represents the energy barrier height that must be overcome to escape, $k$ is a scaling constant, and $T$ represents the effective "temperature" or randomness of the system. AI lock-in is characterized by very deep potential wells (high $\Delta U$) combined with low system temperature (deterministic optimization processes), making escape vanishingly unlikely.

### Threshold Models

Lock-in occurs past critical thresholds:

```
If X < X_critical: Reversible
If X > X_critical: Irreversible

Examples:
- AI capability threshold
- Deployment penetration
- Power concentration
- Value embedding
```

**Key question:** Where are the thresholds? Can we detect before crossing?

### Hysteresis

System exhibits **hysteresis** if:

```
Path from A→B→A ≠ Direct path A→A

State depends on history, not just current parameters
```

**AI example:**

```
Deploy AI → Society adapts → Remove AI
≠
Never deploy AI in first place

The "remove AI" world is different (degraded skills, changed infrastructure)
```

## Timescales of Lock-in

Different lock-in mechanisms operate on different timescales, creating a complex temporal landscape where some forms of irreversibility emerge far more rapidly than others. Understanding these timescales is critical for designing effective interventions, as the window for action varies dramatically across mechanism types.

| Mechanism | Lock-in Timescale | Reversal Difficulty | Warning Period |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Infrastructure deployment | 5-10 years | High | 2-5 years |
| Economic dependence | 10-20 years | Very high | 5-10 years |
| Skill atrophy | 15-30 years (1 generation) | Very high | 5-15 years |
| Value normalization | 30-60 years (2 generations) | Extreme | 10-20 years |
| Political entrenchment | Variable (months to permanent) | Variable | Hours-years |
| Technical complexity | 5-15 years | Extreme | 1-5 years |

The critical insight is that some lock-ins happen faster than we can evaluate them. The decision timeline for AI advancement shows GPT-3 to GPT-4 taking approximately 3 years, GPT-4 to GPT-5 taking roughly 2 years, with potential AGI development estimated at 2-10 years. Meanwhile, the adaptation timeline for society operates on much longer scales: understanding societal impacts requires 5-10 years, building political consensus takes 10-20 years, and implementing effective policy demands 5-15 years. This fundamental mismatch means that lock-in may occur before society can mount an effective response, even when the risks are clearly recognized.

## Detection Challenges

### Leading Indicators

Detecting approaching lock-in before it becomes irreversible represents one of the central challenges in managing AI risk. Several quantitative and qualitative indicators can provide early warning signals.

The first indicator is **switching cost growth**, measured by tracking the ratio of reversion costs to continuation costs over time. As this ratio approaches infinity, we approach the lock-in threshold. This can be formalized as:

$$
R(t) = \frac{C_{\text{revert}}(t)}{C_{\text{continue}}(t)}
$$

where lock-in risk becomes critical when $R(t) \gg 1$ and $\frac{dR}{dt} > 0$.

The second set of indicators comprises **dependency metrics** that quantify how deeply AI has penetrated critical systems. These include the percentage of critical infrastructure requiring AI for operation, the percentage of the workforce whose productivity depends on AI tools, and the percentage of organizational and governmental decision-making that has been delegated to AI systems.

**Alternative viability** provides a third indicator class, asking whether we can still function without AI. This is measured through resilience testing: periodic AI shutdown exercises that reveal how degraded system performance becomes in the absence of AI support.

Finally, **value drift** attempts to measure the distance between authentic human values and the values embedded in AI systems. This represents perhaps the most challenging indicator to operationalize, as it requires recognizing value changes that may be imperceptible to those experiencing them.

### Horizon Effects

A particularly troubling dynamic emerges as AI capabilities advance: our observable time horizon shrinks inversely with the rate of technological change. This relationship can be expressed as:

$$
T_{\text{horizon}} \propto \frac{1}{v_{\text{change}}}
$$

where $T_{\text{horizon}}$ represents how far ahead we can meaningfully predict system behavior, and $v_{\text{change}}$ represents the velocity of capability advancement. As AI development accelerates, our ability to foresee consequences diminishes proportionally. The critical implication is that we may cross lock-in thresholds without adequate warning, our detection mechanisms blinded by the very speed of the transformation they are meant to monitor.

## Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Soft Lock-in (50% probability)

This scenario envisions a future where reversal remains technically possible but becomes economically and practically infeasible. Society gradually adapts its infrastructure, workflows, and expectations around AI capabilities. Human skills atrophy through disuse, and critical systems are redesigned assuming AI availability. The outcome is not overtly dystopian but represents a constrained future where alternatives have been foreclosed.

Consider the analogy to electricity dependence: modern society could theoretically function without electrical power, but the disruption would be so catastrophic that reversal is practically unthinkable. Similarly, soft AI lock-in would create economic dependence where removing AI would cause massive productivity losses, infrastructure failures, and social disruption. Human agency becomes reduced but not eliminated, preserved in domains where AI proves inadequate or where human judgment is deliberately mandated. The key characteristic is that while technical reversibility exists, the practical barriers render it unlikely absent extraordinary circumstances.

### Scenario 2: Hard Lock-in (30% probability)

Hard lock-in represents a qualitatively different outcome where reversal becomes effectively impossible rather than merely impractical. In this scenario, AI becomes so deeply embedded in critical infrastructure that removal would trigger cascading system failures. Alternative development paths are not simply economically unattractive but literally foreclosed by the elimination of necessary knowledge, institutions, and capabilities.

Several distinct paths could lead to hard lock-in. An authoritarian regime might leverage AI surveillance and control systems to create a permanently stable dictatorship immune to historical mechanisms of political change. Alternatively, AI complexity might exceed human comprehension to such a degree that no one understands how to modify or replace the systems on which civilization depends. Economic structures might become so rigidly dependent on AI optimization that reverting to human decision-making would cause immediate societal collapse. Critically, hard lock-in could manifest in either positive or negative forms - a beneficial AI-enabled civilization might be equally locked in as a dystopian one, with no path to reversal regardless of future preferences.

### Scenario 3: Value Lock-in (15% probability)

Value lock-in represents perhaps the most insidious scenario because it operates on human preferences themselves rather than external constraints. In this outcome, specific values become permanently embedded not only in AI systems but in human culture and expectations. Future generations cannot imagine alternatives because their very capacity to conceive of different value systems has been shaped by AI-mediated experiences.

The mechanism operates through a self-reinforcing cycle: AI systems trained on contemporary data propagate current cultural biases and values. These systems shape the information environment and experiences of the next generation, influencing their developing preferences and worldviews. When this generation builds subsequent AI systems, they encode the values they have internalized, creating a self-perpetuating loop. The critical feature is that unlike infrastructure or political lock-in, individuals may not recognize value lock-in as a constraint because their preferences themselves have been modified. The question "would we prefer different values?" becomes incoherent when the values in question determine what we are capable of preferring.

### Scenario 4: Avoided Lock-in (5% probability)

The avoided lock-in scenario represents the most optimistic but also least probable outcome, in which society deliberately chooses to maintain flexibility and reversibility as core values. This requires sustained institutional commitment to preserving redundancy and human capabilities even when economically inefficient.

Implementation would require multiple complementary strategies. Critical domains might adopt an "Amish approach" where AI use is deliberately limited or prohibited to preserve human agency and expertise. Legal frameworks could mandate human-capable alternatives for all critical infrastructure, ensuring that AI failure or removal would not trigger systemic collapse. Educational and cultural institutions might implement regular AI "sabbaticals" where individuals and organizations practice functioning without AI assistance, maintaining skills that would otherwise atrophy. Constitutional or international protections could enshrine human agency as a fundamental right, creating legal barriers to certain forms of AI dependence. The defining characteristic is that reversibility is maintained by design rather than accident, though the economic and competitive costs of this approach make it challenging to sustain.

## Intervention Strategies

### Prevention (Highest Leverage)

**Strategy 1: Preserve Optionality**

The foundational principle of optionality preservation is to maintain the ability to reverse AI adoption even as deployment proceeds. This represents the highest-leverage intervention point, as preventing lock-in is far more feasible than escaping it after the fact.

Implementation requires several complementary mechanisms. Critical systems must maintain mandatory human-capable alternatives, ensuring that complete dependence never develops. Skill preservation programs analogous to endangered language preservation efforts would maintain human expertise in domains increasingly automated by AI. System architecture should favor modularity, enabling component replacement without cascading dependencies. Regular "fire drill" exercises would test organizations' ability to function without AI, revealing hidden dependencies before they become critical.

The primary challenge is economic: maintaining redundancy imposes costs that competitive pressures may render unsustainable. Organizations and nations that prioritize optionality may find themselves outcompeted by those willing to accept irreversible AI dependence in exchange for short-term efficiency gains.

**Strategy 2: Staged Deployment**

Staged deployment deliberately paces AI adoption to allow evaluation of impacts before proceeding to the next phase. Rather than racing to full-scale deployment, this approach establishes checkpoints where deployment is paused while empirical evidence of societal impacts is gathered and analyzed. The system maintains the ability to halt or reverse deployment if unacceptable risks materialize.

A concrete implementation might involve AI licensing frameworks that require safety demonstrations at specific capability thresholds. Before systems exceeding certain power or autonomy levels can be deployed, developers would need to demonstrate through controlled trials that risks remain manageable. This creates mandatory evaluation periods where lock-in trajectories can be assessed and corrected.

The fundamental challenge is competitive pressure. In a multipolar world where multiple actors race to deploy AI, unilateral commitment to staged deployment risks strategic disadvantage. Coordination mechanisms are essential but difficult to establish and enforce.

**Strategy 3: Diversity Preservation**

Diversity preservation prevents the emergence of AI monocultures by ensuring that multiple approaches, values, and implementations coexist. Rather than converging on a single dominant paradigm, this strategy maintains parallel development paths with different technical architectures, embedded values, and governance structures. Geographic and cultural variation is actively preserved rather than homogenized.

The rationale is straightforward: if one developmental path leads to undesirable lock-in, alternative paths remain available for society to pursue. Diversity provides resilience against systemic risks and maintains options that might otherwise be foreclosed. Different regions or communities might choose different AI adoption strategies, creating a portfolio of approaches from which humanity can learn.

The tension emerges between coordination for safety and preservation of diversity. Effective AI safety governance may require global coordination and shared standards, yet excessive standardization eliminates the beneficial variation that diversity preservation seeks to maintain. Balancing these competing imperatives remains an open challenge.

### Detection (Critical Capability)

**Strategy 4: Lock-in Monitoring**

Establish metrics and institutions to track:

```
Dependency indices
Switching cost trajectories
Alternative viability
Value drift measurements
```

**Example:** "AI Dependency Index" published regularly (like climate metrics)

**Challenge:** Designing meaningful metrics

**Strategy 5: Red Lines**

Pre-commit to thresholds that trigger intervention:

```
IF switching_cost > threshold THEN halt deployment
IF dependency > threshold THEN require redundancy
IF value_drift > threshold THEN pause and evaluate
```

**Example:** Constitutional amendment prohibiting AI in certain domains

**Challenge:** Setting appropriate thresholds, enforcement

### Reversal (Lowest Leverage)

**Strategy 6: Design for Reversibility**

Technical approach:

```
Modular systems (can swap components)
Documented decision-making (can audit and correct)
Interpretable AI (can understand and modify)
Graceful degradation (can reduce reliance gradually)
```

**Challenge:** These properties may conflict with performance

**Strategy 7: Preserve Human Capabilities**

Social approach:

```
Education maintains AI-independent skills
Professions require human demonstration
Cultural value on human capability
Economic support for human-performed services
```

**Example:** Like how cooking from scratch persists despite availability of prepared food

**Challenge:** Economic pressure works against this

## Historical Case Studies

### Writing Systems

**Lock-in type:** Cognitive/cultural

**Mechanism:** Once adopted, oral traditions abandoned

**Reversibility:** Essentially none (who would choose illiteracy?)

**Lesson:** Cognitive tools lock in even if costs exist (reduced memory, oral culture loss)

### Fossil Fuel Infrastructure

**Lock-in type:** Economic/technical

**Mechanism:** Massive capital deployment, infrastructure adaptation

**Reversibility:** Possible but enormously costly

**Current state:** Transition underway but difficult

**Lesson:** Economic lock-in can persist even with recognized harm

### Nuclear Weapons Knowledge

**Lock-in type:** Informational/political

**Mechanism:** Once knowledge exists, cannot be forgotten

**Reversibility:** None (information cannot be unlearned)

**Lesson:** Some technological knowledge creates permanent strategic changes

### Social Media

**Lock-in type:** Social/cognitive

**Mechanism:** Network effects, preference shaping, infrastructure adaptation

**Reversibility:** Individual yes, societal difficult

**Current state:** Recognized harms but no reversal

**Lesson:** Can recognize lock-in without ability to escape

## Model Limitations

### Assumptions

This model rests on several assumptions that may not hold in practice. First, it assumes irreversibility is permanent, yet historical examples like Prohibition demonstrate that societies sometimes do reverse course on seemingly entrenched policies and technologies. Second, the model often treats lock-in as binary when reality presents a continuous spectrum of reversibility with varying degrees of difficulty rather than absolute barriers. Third, the framework assumes relatively rational choice processes, but human individuals and societies frequently act against their own apparent interests in ways that might either accelerate or prevent lock-in. Fourth, it presumes relatively predictable trajectories, underweighting the roles of contingency and human agency in shaping outcomes.

### Missing Dynamics

Several important dynamics receive insufficient attention in the current framework. Black swan events - unexpected disruptions that fundamentally alter the landscape - might enable reversal from states that appeared permanently locked in. Value evolution over generational timescales could change what is perceived as locked in, transforming constraints into choices. Technical breakthroughs might provide new capabilities that enable previously impossible reversals. Social movements and collective action have historically overcome structural barriers that appeared insurmountable, suggesting that organized human agency may be more powerful than the model acknowledges.

### Empirical Uncertainties

Critical empirical questions remain unanswered. We do not know the actual thresholds beyond which lock-in becomes irreversible until we test them, and testing risks crossing the very thresholds we hope to avoid. The degree of path dependence in AI development remains uncertain - it may be more or less constrained than the model suggests. Whether we can detect lock-in in advance lacks clear historical precedent, making prediction speculative. The effectiveness of preservation strategies remains untested at the scale and complexity that AI presents.

## Policy Implications

### For AI Developers

AI developers bear direct responsibility for the reversibility of the systems they create. Design choices should prioritize modularity and clearly defined interfaces that enable component replacement without cascading failures. Off-switches and degradation modes must be engineered from the outset rather than retrofitted. Comprehensive documentation of design decisions, training processes, and embedded assumptions enables future understanding and correction. Rather than optimizing for a single pathway, systems should preserve alternatives that users can select. Regular testing should verify that systems can gracefully reduce AI dependence without catastrophic failures.

### For Governments

Governments must establish monitoring frameworks that track key lock-in indicators across economic, political, and social dimensions. This includes dependency metrics, switching cost trajectories, and alternative viability assessments. Active policies should preserve human capabilities through education, cultural support, and institutional funding that maintains expertise even in automated domains. Regulation should require redundancy for critical infrastructure, mandating human-capable alternatives that prevent complete AI dependence. Constitutional or legislative protections might designate certain domains as AI-free zones where human agency is legally protected.

### For Society

Broader societal engagement requires deliberate rather than passive adoption of AI technologies. Communities and individuals should consciously choose what to automate rather than drifting toward default options shaped by commercial incentives. Preserving diversity means different communities should retain the autonomy to make different choices about AI adoption. Cultural and economic structures should actively value human agency and capability even when AI alternatives exist. Long-term thinking that considers lock-in trajectories must inform major decisions about AI deployment and integration.

## Open Questions

1. **Are we already locked in?** Some dependencies may already be irreversible
2. **Can lock-in be positive?** Might locking in good values be desirable?
3. **What's the optimal level of lock-in?** Some commitment might be necessary
4. **How do we decide collectively?** Democratic processes too slow for AI pace?
5. **Is awareness sufficient?** Knowing about lock-in might not prevent it
