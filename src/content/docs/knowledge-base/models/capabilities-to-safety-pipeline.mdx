## Overview

This model analyzes the flow of researchers from AI capabilities work to AI safety research. Given the talent constraints in AI safety, the pool of experienced ML researchers represents the largest potential source of new safety researchers. Understanding what motivates transitions, what barriers exist, and what interventions could increase flow is critical for scaling the safety research workforce.

**Central Question:** What determines the rate at which capabilities researchers transition to safety work, and how can this rate be increased?

## The Transition Pipeline

### Current Flow Estimates

**Source Population (2024):**
- Total ML researchers globally: 50,000-100,000
- ML researchers at frontier labs: 5,000-10,000
- ML researchers aware of AI safety concerns: 10,000-30,000
- ML researchers considering safety transition: 1,000-5,000
- ML researchers who actually transition annually: 50-400

**Conversion Funnel:**

| Stage | Population | Conversion Rate |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| All ML researchers | 50,000-100,000 | 100% |
| Aware of safety concerns | 10,000-30,000 | 20-30% |
| Consider transition | 1,000-5,000 | 10-15% of aware |
| Actively exploring | 200-1,000 | 20-30% of considering |
| Actually transition | 50-400 | 25-40% of exploring |

**Key Insight:** The largest drop-off is at the awareness stage and the consideration-to-action stage

## Quality Considerations

### Quality Distribution of Transitioners

| Quality Tier | Current % of Transitioners | Potential Expansion |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| A-tier (top researchers) | 10-20% | Limited (already well-connected) |
| B-tier (strong researchers) | 30-40% | Medium (intervention-responsive) |
| C-tier (competent researchers) | 30-40% | High (large pool) |
| D-tier (developing) | 10-20% | High |

**Quality-Quantity Tradeoff:**
- Current transitioners skew higher quality (self-selected)
- Scaling may lower average quality
- A-tier transitioners have highest impact

### Optimizing for Quality

**Targeted Recruitment:**

- Average quality decreases
- Field reputation suffers
- Fewer quality transitions

**Loop 2: Oversaturation**
- Too many transitioners
- Funding/positions saturated
- Transition becomes less attractive
- Fewer transitions

## Key Uncertainties

<KeyQuestions
  questions={[
    "What fraction of capabilities researchers could realistically be converted to safety?",
    "Does reducing financial barriers significantly increase transitions, or are they primarily values-driven?",
    "Can transition programs maintain quality while scaling?",
    "What is the optimal balance between recruiting experienced researchers vs. training new ones?",
    "How will the transition pipeline change as AI development accelerates?"
