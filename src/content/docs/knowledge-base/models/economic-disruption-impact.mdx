## Overview

This model analyzes the feedback loops, tipping points, and cascade dynamics through which AI automation could create economic instability. It moves beyond simple displacement estimates to examine systemic fragility and adaptation capacity.

**Key Question:** Under what conditions does labor displacement exceed economic adaptation capacity, triggering instability?

## Core System Dynamics

### The Displacement-Adaptation Balance

**System Equation:**
```
Economic_Stability = Adaptation_Rate - Displacement_Rate

Where:
- Adaptation_Rate = New_Job_Creation + Retraining_Success + Safety_Net_Adequacy
- Displacement_Rate = AI_Capability_Growth × Deployment_Speed × Job_Susceptibility
```

**Stability Condition:**
```
Stable: Adaptation_Rate ≥ Displacement_Rate
Unstable: Adaptation_Rate < Displacement_Rate
Critical: Gap widens over time (acceleration)
```

### Current State Assessment

**Displacement Rate (2024-2025):**

| Component | Estimate | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| AI capability growth | 20-40% annual capability gains | Medium |
| Deployment speed | Accelerating (ChatGPT → mass adoption in 18 months) | High |
| Job susceptibility | 6-47% of jobs (wide range) | Low |
| **Net displacement rate** | ~2-5% workforce over next 5 years | Low |

**Adaptation Rate (2024-2025):**

| Component | Capacity | Effectiveness |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| New job creation | AI creating ~120K jobs/year (2024) | Limited (vs. millions at risk) |
| Retraining programs | Underfunded, mixed success | Low-Medium |
| Safety net capacity | Designed for 4-6% unemployment | Inadequate for >10% |
| **Net adaptation rate** | ~1-3% workforce/year | Medium confidence |

**Current Balance:** Roughly balanced to slight deficit
- No broad labor disruption visible yet (Yale Budget Lab 2024)
- But: Early warning signs in specific sectors (tech, creative work)
- Trend: Displacement accelerating, adaptation not keeping pace

## Feedback Loops

### Destabilizing Loops (Positive Feedback)

**Loop 1: Displacement Cascade**
```
Job losses → Reduced consumer spending → Business revenue decline →
More cost-cutting via AI → More job losses
```
- **Time constant:** 6-18 months
- **Amplification factor:** 1.5-3x (each job lost triggers 0.5-2 additional losses)
- **Historical precedent:** 2008 recession cascades
- **Threshold:** Unemployment >7-8% triggers significant cascade

**Loop 2: Inequality Spiral**
```
AI benefits capital → Income concentration → Reduced mass market →
Businesses optimize for wealthy → More automation → More concentration
```
- **Time constant:** 3-10 years
- **Amplification factor:** Gini coefficient increasing 0.02-0.05/decade
- **Threshold:** Gini >0.5 associated with instability

**Loop 3: Skills Obsolescence Race**
```
AI capabilities advance → Skills become obsolete → Workers retrain →
New skills also automated → Perpetual inadequacy
```
- **Time constant:** 2-5 years per skill cycle
- **Critical condition:** AI learning faster than human retraining (currently approaching)
- **Outcome:** Permanent unemployability for some cohorts

**Loop 4: Safety Net Collapse**
```
Job losses → Increased safety net demand → Government budget strain →
Reduced services → Social instability → Political dysfunction →
Worse policy → More disruption
```
- **Time constant:** 2-5 years
- **Threshold:** Safety net demand >150% of capacity
- **Risk:** Political backlash, anti-AI sentiment, potential regulation backlash

**Loop 5: Geographic Concentration**
```
AI benefits cluster in tech hubs → Regional inequality → Migration →
Local economic collapse in left-behind regions → Political extremism →
National instability
```
- **Time constant:** 5-15 years
- **Historical precedent:** Manufacturing hollowing-out
- **Amplification:** AI concentration higher than previous tech waves

### Stabilizing Loops (Negative Feedback)

**Loop 1: New Job Creation**
```
AI capability → New AI-related jobs → Employment → Slows disruption
```
- **Effectiveness:** Limited (120K new jobs vs. potential millions displaced)
- **Constraint:** New jobs require high skills, not accessible to all displaced workers

**Loop 2: Complementarity Effects**
```
AI augments workers → Productivity increase → Business growth →
More hiring → Offsets displacement
```
- **Effectiveness:** Variable by sector (high in some, low in others)
- **Constraint:** Requires workers to adapt, firms to share productivity gains

**Loop 3: Political Response**
```
Disruption → Voter pressure → Policy intervention → Slowed deployment or stronger safety net
```
- **Effectiveness:** Uncertain (political lag, lobbying resistance)
- **Constraint:** May be too slow, or counterproductive (blocking innovation)

**Loop 4: Price Reductions**
```
AI efficiency → Lower costs → Cheaper goods → Increased purchasing power →
More demand → More jobs
```
- **Effectiveness:** Uncertain (distributional issues, if workers have no income can't buy)
- **Constraint:** Requires gains distributed broadly, not concentrated

## Threshold Analysis

### Critical Thresholds

**Threshold 1: Retraining Impossibility (APPROACHING)**

**Condition:**
```
AI_learning_rate > Human_retraining_rate
AND
Skill_half-life < Retraining_duration
```

**Current Status:**
- AI capabilities: Doubling every 12-18 months in some domains
- Human retraining: Typically 2-4 years for new career
- Skill half-life: Decreasing (10-15 years → 3-5 years)

**Implication:** Perpetual skill chase becomes futile for significant population

**Estimated Time to Threshold:** 3-7 years (some workers already there)

**Threshold 2: Safety Net Saturation (NOT YET)**

**Condition:**
```
Unemployment_rate > Safety_net_capacity
OR
Unemployment_duration > Benefit_duration
```

**Current Capacity:**
- U.S. unemployment insurance: Designed for 4-6% unemployment, 26 weeks
- Other programs: Food stamps, Medicaid (means-tested, limited)

**Breaking Point:** ~10-15% sustained unemployment

**Current Status:** 3-4% unemployment (well below threshold)

**Projection:** Could reach threshold within 5-10 years if displacement accelerates

**Threshold 3: Political Instability (NOT YET)**

**Condition:**
```
(Unemployment > 15%) OR (Income_Gini > 0.55) OR (Regional_inequality > threshold)
```

**Historical Evidence:**
- Unemployment >15%: Associated with regime change, extremism, unrest
- Gini >0.55: Associated with political instability (Brazil, South Africa)

**Current Status:**
- U.S. unemployment: 3-4%
- U.S. Gini: 0.49 (already high, but stable)

**Projection:** 10-20 years if current trends continue, faster if shock

**Threshold 4: Demand Collapse (SPECULATIVE)**

**Condition:**
```
Labor_income_share < Minimum_for_demand
(Too much income to capital, not enough consumer spending)
```

**Mechanism:**
- AI replaces workers → Labor share of income declines → Consumer spending drops → Economic contraction

**Historical Data:**
- Labor share of GDP: Declining from ~65% (1970s) to ~60% (2020s)
- Critical threshold: Unknown, but likely 40-50%

**Projection:** 15-30 years (very uncertain)

**Threshold 5: Societal Fragility (LONG-TERM)**

**Condition:**
```
Percentage_economically_useful < Societal_cohesion_threshold
```

**Concern:** If AI can do most economically valuable work, large population may have no economic role

**Consequence:** Meaning crisis, political instability, potential societal breakdown

**Projection:** 20-50 years (highly speculative, depends on TAI)

- Reduces future displacement

**Challenges:**
- Long time lag (20+ years)
- Uncertain what skills will remain valuable
- Doesn't help current workers
- Implementation difficulty

## Interactions with Other Risk Factors

**Economic Disruption + Racing Dynamics:**
- Racing pressure → Faster deployment → Less time for adaptation → Worse disruption
- Reinforcing

**Economic Disruption + Winner-Take-All:**
- Winner-take-all → Extreme concentration → Worse inequality → Political instability
- Reinforcing

**Economic Disruption + Political Instability (downstream risk):**
- Economic pain → Political extremism → Bad policy → Worse outcomes
- Potential cascade to structural risks

**Economic Disruption + Expertise Atrophy:**
- Job loss → Skills unused → Atrophy → Harder to re-employ
- Reinforcing

## Model Limitations

**1. Assumes Historical Relationships Hold**
- Reality: AI may be fundamentally different from previous automation
- Impact: Could be over- or under-estimating disruption

**2. Aggregate Analysis Misses Distributional Details**
- Reality: Different groups affected very differently
- Impact: May miss localized crises even if aggregate okay

**3. Uncertain AI Capability Trajectory**
- Reality: AI progress could accelerate, plateau, or be uneven
- Impact: Wide uncertainty in timelines

**4. Political Response Unpredictable**
- Reality: Policy could dramatically change trajectories
- Impact: Outcomes very uncertain

**5. Doesn't Model Global Dynamics**
- Reality: Disruption may shift geographically (offshoring, onshoring)
- Impact: May miss global instability even if U.S. okay

**6. Assumes Away AI Benefits**
- Reality: AI may create abundance, new possibilities
- Impact: May be too pessimistic if AI dramatically increases productivity

## Trend Projections
