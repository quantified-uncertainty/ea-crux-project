## Overview

AI risks don't exist in isolation. The **Risk Interaction Matrix** provides a systematic framework for analyzing how different risk categories interact, potentially amplifying each other (synergistic effects) or sometimes offsetting (antagonistic effects).

**Key insight:** Linear risk assessment dramatically underestimates total risk when interactions create multiplicative or threshold effects.

## The Interaction Framework

### Interaction Types

1. **Synergistic (+):** Combined effect exceeds sum of individual risks
2. **Additive (0):** Combined effect equals sum of individual risks
3. **Antagonistic (-):** Combined effect less than sum (risks partially offset)
4. **Threshold (T):** One risk creates conditions for another to manifest
5. **Cascading (C):** One risk triggers another in sequence

### Key Risk Pairs and Their Interactions

| Risk A | Risk B | Type | Mechanism |
|--------|--------|------|-----------|
| Racing Dynamics | Misalignment | + | Speed pressure reduces safety investment |
| Deepfakes | Epistemic Collapse | C | Authenticity crisis compounds information problems |
| Economic Disruption | Political Instability | + | Job loss fuels extremism, reduces governance capacity |
| Bioweapons | Proliferation | T | Open models enable bioweapon development |
| Surveillance | Authoritarianism | + | AI surveillance enables unprecedented control |
| Cyberweapons | Critical Infrastructure | C | AI cyber capabilities target essential systems |

## Formal Model

### Pairwise Interaction Score

For risks R_i and R_j with individual severity scores S_i and S_j:

```
Combined_Severity(R_i, R_j) = S_i + S_j + I(R_i, R_j) * sqrt(S_i * S_j)

Where:
- I(R_i, R_j) = interaction coefficient [-1, +2]
- I > 0: synergistic
- I = 0: additive
- I < 0: antagonistic
```

### Portfolio Risk

Total risk across n risks:

```
Portfolio_Risk = Sum(S_i) + Sum_pairs(I_ij * sqrt(S_i * S_j))
```

**Note:** Second term can dominate when multiple strong synergies exist.

## High-Priority Interaction Clusters

### Cluster 1: Capability-Governance Gap

**Risks involved:** Racing dynamics, Proliferation, Regulatory lag

**Mechanism:** Racing creates pressure to deploy before governance catches up. Proliferation spreads capabilities to actors outside any governance framework. Creates expanding ungoverned capability frontier.

**Interaction strength:** High synergy (+1.5)

### Cluster 2: Information Ecosystem Collapse

**Risks involved:** Deepfakes, Disinformation, Epistemic collapse, Trust erosion

**Mechanism:** Each risk degrades the foundations others rely on. Deepfakes enable disinformation. Disinformation causes epistemis collapse. Collapse erodes trust. Low trust makes verification harder.

**Interaction strength:** Cascading with positive feedback

### Cluster 3: Concentration-Control Nexus

**Risks involved:** Winner-take-all, Surveillance, Lock-in, Authoritarianism

**Mechanism:** Economic concentration enables surveillance investment. Surveillance enables control. Control enables lock-in. Lock-in prevents course correction.

**Interaction strength:** Sequential amplification

## Implications for Prioritization

### Standard Approach Problems

Traditional risk prioritization:
1. Assess each risk independently
2. Rank by expected severity
3. Allocate resources proportionally

**Problem:** Ignores interaction effects that may constitute majority of actual risk.

### Interaction-Aware Prioritization

Better approach:
1. Identify high-interaction clusters
2. Prioritize interventions that break multiple interaction chains
3. Weight risks by both direct severity AND interaction contribution

### High-Leverage Interventions

Interventions that reduce multiple risks through interaction chains:

| Intervention | Primary Target | Secondary Effects (via interactions) |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------------------------|
| AI governance coordination | Racing dynamics | Reduces proliferation pressure, gives time for safety |
| Content authentication | Deepfakes | Slows epistemic collapse, maintains trust |
| Antitrust for AI | Concentration | Prevents surveillance/lock-in cascade |
| Safety standards | Misalignment | Breaks racing-misalignment synergy |

## Limitations and Uncertainties

### Model Limitations

1. **Interaction coefficients are uncertain** - Few empirical data points
2. **Interactions may be context-dependent** - Same risks interact differently in different scenarios
3. **Higher-order interactions** - Model only captures pairwise; 3+ way interactions possible
4. **Dynamic interactions** - Coefficients likely change over time

### Research Priorities

1. **Empirical grounding:** Historical case studies of technology risk interactions
2. **Expert elicitation:** Systematic surveys to estimate interaction coefficients
3. **Scenario analysis:** Test model predictions against detailed scenarios
4. **Dynamic modeling:** Extend to time-varying interactions
