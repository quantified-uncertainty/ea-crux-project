# Model Enhancement Task Queue

This file tracks which models need enhancement to match the STYLE_GUIDE.md standards. Each Claude Code session should:

1. Read this file and STYLE_GUIDE.md
2. Pick 3-5 models marked as `[ ]` (pending)
3. Mark them as `[~]` (in progress) before starting
4. Enhance them using parallel Task agents (see workflow below)
5. Mark as `[x]` (complete) when done
6. Commit changes

## Workflow for Each Session

### Context Management
- Work in batches of **3-5 models maximum** per session
- Use parallel Task agents to enhance models simultaneously
- Each agent writes directly to the file (don't return content to main conversation)
- Run `/compact` proactively after each batch if continuing

### Agent Instructions Template
When spawning enhancement agents, use this prompt structure:

```
Read STYLE_GUIDE.md and the model file [filename].mdx.
Enhance the model to match style guide standards:
- Add/improve Overview with flowing prose
- Add Mermaid diagram if missing
- Add quantitative tables with estimates, ranges, confidence
- Add scenario analysis where applicable
- Ensure Limitations section exists
- Update lastEdited to current date

Write the enhanced content directly to the file. Do not return the full content.
Report only: "Enhanced [filename] - added [list key additions]"
```

### Commit Message Format
```
Enhance [N] analytical models: [list model names]
```

## Enhancement Status

Legend:
- `[ ]` = Pending (not yet enhanced)
- `[~]` = In Progress (being worked on by current session)
- `[x]` = Complete (matches style guide)

## Notes for Claude Code Sessions

1. **Don't try to do everything at once** - Context fills up fast with long content
2. **Commit after each batch** - So progress is saved even if session dies
3. **Mark files as in-progress** - Prevents other sessions from duplicate work
4. **Use Task agents with `run_in_background: true`** - They write directly, reducing context
5. **If context gets low** - Stop, commit what's done, note progress here, start new session
