## Overview

This model analyzes the expected value of marginal investments in AI safety research. The central question: **How much does additional safety research reduce catastrophic risk, and how does this compare to other uses of resources?**

The analysis is complicated by deep uncertainty about:
- The probability and magnitude of AI risks
- The tractability of safety problems
- Counterfactual outcomes (what happens without additional research)
- Time horizons and discount rates

## Basic Expected Value Framework

### The Core Calculation

**Expected Value of Safety Research:**

```
EV(safety research) = P(AI risk) × Reduction(risk | research) × Value(prevented harm) - Cost(research)

Where:
- P(AI risk) = Probability of catastrophic AI outcome without intervention
- Reduction(risk | research) = Fractional reduction in risk from marginal research
- Value(prevented harm) = Expected harm avoided (in utility or $)
- Cost(research) = Direct and opportunity costs
```

### Parameter Estimates

**P(AI risk) - Probability of Catastrophic Outcome:**

| Estimate Source | P(existential risk) | P(catastrophic non-existential) |
|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Ord (2020) | 10% this century | Higher |
| AI Impacts survey (2022) | ~5% median | ~15-20% |
| Metaculus | ~3% | Variable |
| Skeptical view | &lt;1% | ~5% |

**Wide uncertainty:** 1-20% for existential risk is a reasonable range

**Reduction(risk | research) - Marginal Impact:**

| View | Reduction per $1B | Rationale |
|------|-------------------|-----------|
| Optimistic | 10-50% | Safety highly tractable, early work has high returns |
| Moderate | 1-10% | Safety tractable but difficult, diminishing returns |
| Pessimistic | &lt;1% | Safety problems fundamentally hard |

**Value(prevented harm):**

For existential risk:
- Total future value: Astronomical (10^18+ lives under some frameworks)
- Present value at 0% discount: ~10^18-10^30 utility units
- Present value at 2% discount: Still enormous

For catastrophic but non-existential:
- 10-50% of world GDP over decades
- $50-500 trillion present value

## Comparative Analysis

### Comparison to Other Interventions

| Intervention | Cost per Life-Year | Uncertainty | Scale |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| GiveDirectly | ~$100-300 | Low | Medium |
| Malaria nets | ~$50-100 | Low | Medium |
| AI Safety (optimistic) | &lt;$0.01 | Very High | Unbounded |
| AI Safety (moderate) | ~$1-10 | Very High | Unbounded |
| AI Safety (pessimistic) | >$1000 | Very High | Unbounded |

**Key insight:** Under expected value maximization with any significant existential risk probability, AI safety dominates most interventions—but this depends heavily on tractability assumptions.

### Option Value Considerations

Safety research may have value beyond direct risk reduction:

**1. Information Value**
- Reduces uncertainty about AI risk severity
- Enables better resource allocation

**2. Optionality**
- Creates tools and knowledge for future decisions
- Keeps options open as AI develops

**3. Institutional Capacity**
- Builds safety-focused research community
- Creates regulatory knowledge base

**4. Signal Value**
- Demonstrates seriousness about safety
- Influences AI lab behavior

## Marginal Returns Analysis

### Current Safety Spending (2024)

| Actor | Estimated Annual Spending | Focus |
|-------|--------------------------|-------|
| Anthropic | $100M+ | Interpretability, alignment |
| OpenAI | $50-100M | Alignment, evaluation |
| DeepMind | $50-100M | Safety research |
| Academia | $30-50M | Various |
| Philanthropic | $100-200M | Grants, policy |
| **Total** | **~$400-600M** | |

**vs. Capabilities Spending:** $50-100B (100:1 ratio)

### Diminishing Returns Curve

```
Returns(funding) = A × funding^(-α)

Where α ≈ 0.3-0.5 (diminishing returns)

At current funding levels (~$500M):
- Next $100M: Potentially high returns
- Next $1B: Moderate returns
- Next $10B: Uncertain (may hit bottlenecks)
```

### Bottlenecks

1. **Talent:** Limited number of researchers with relevant skills (~500-1000 FTE in safety)
2. **Research Direction Clarity:** Uncertain which approaches are most valuable
3. **Coordination with Capabilities:** Safety research needs access to frontier systems

### Within Safety Research

| Area | Current Funding | Marginal Returns | Uncertainty |
|------|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Interpretability | High | Medium | Medium |
| Alignment theory | Medium | High? | Very High |
| Evaluations/Red-teaming | Medium | High | Low |
| Governance/Policy | Medium | High | Medium |
| Field-building | Low | High | Medium |

## Robustness Analysis

### Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | P(x-risk) | Tractability | Timeline | EV of Safety Research |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|----------------------|
| High risk, tractable | 15% | High | 10 years | Extremely high |
| High risk, intractable | 15% | Low | 10 years | Low |
| Low risk, tractable | 2% | High | 20 years | High |
| Low risk, intractable | 2% | Low | 50 years | Low |

**Robust conclusions:**
1. If any significant risk AND tractable: Safety research very valuable
2. If intractable: Need different interventions (governance, pause)
3. Uncertainty itself argues for research (information value)

### Value of Information

**Research as Information Gathering:**

```
Value of Info = Σ P(world_i) × [Utility(optimal action | know world_i) - Utility(current action)]
```

**Estimate:** 10-30% of safety research value may be informational rather than direct risk reduction

## Recommendations

### Investment Levels

**Current (2024):** ~$500M/year

**Suggested Target:** $1-3B/year in next 5 years
- 5-10x increase from current
- Still small vs. capabilities
- Focus on capacity building

### Funding Priorities

**Near-term (0-2 years):**
1. Talent pipeline (fellowships, training programs)
2. Evaluations and red-teaming
3. Governance and policy research

**Medium-term (2-5 years):**
1. Scale proven approaches
2. Build academic infrastructure
3. International safety research cooperation

## Model Limitations

1. **Expected Value Framework May Be Wrong** - Risk aversion, bounded utility may apply
2. **Tractability Estimates Are Guesses** - No empirical basis for reduction percentages
3. **Neglects Political Economy** - Lab incentives, regulatory dynamics matter
4. **Assumes Current Understanding** - May be focusing on wrong problems
