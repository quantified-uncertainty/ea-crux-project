## Overview

The proliferation of AI-generated content creates novel vectors for psychological harm at scale. This model examines how synthetic media can trigger, exacerbate, or weaponize psychological vulnerabilities in susceptible individuals, potentially creating cascading effects across populations.

**Core Question:** How might AI-generated content contribute to psychological distress at population scale, and what are the dynamics of such cascades?

## Mechanisms of Harm

### Direct Exposure Effects

| Vector | Mechanism | Vulnerable Population | Severity |
|--------|-----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Deepfake targeting** | Synthetic content depicting individual in harmful scenarios | Specific targets | High |
| **Reality confusion** | Inability to distinguish real from synthetic | Elderly, those with cognitive decline | Moderate-High |
| **Personalized harassment** | AI-generated content tailored to individual fears | Anxiety/PTSD sufferers | High |
| **Parasocial manipulation** | AI personas exploiting attachment needs | Lonely, socially isolated | Moderate |

### Cascade Pathways

```
Initial Trigger → Individual Distress → Social Amplification → Community Impact
                                     ↓
                        Institutional Trust Erosion
                                     ↓
                        Collective Uncertainty
```

## Population Vulnerability Model

### Risk Factor Decomposition

The probability of cascade emergence depends on:

P(cascade) = P(trigger) × P(vulnerable_exposure) × P(amplification) × P(institutional_failure)

**Component Estimates:**

| Factor | Estimate | Uncertainty | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| P(trigger) | 0.9 | Low | Given sufficient synthetic content volume |
| P(vulnerable_exposure) | 0.15-0.30 | Moderate | Percentage with relevant vulnerabilities |
| P(amplification) | 0.3-0.6 | High | Depends on social/media dynamics |
| P(institutional_failure) | 0.2-0.5 | High | Depends on preparedness |

### Vulnerability Distribution

Population segments by susceptibility:

| Segment | % of Population | Primary Vulnerability | Risk Multiplier |
|---------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Pre-existing psychosis | 1-3% | Reality testing deficits | 5-10× |
| Anxiety disorders | 15-20% | Threat hypervigilance | 2-3× |
| Trust erosion | 30-40% | Institutional skepticism | 1.5-2× |
| Information overload | 50-60% | Decision paralysis | 1.2-1.5× |
| Baseline resilient | 20-30% | Standard vulnerability | 1× |

## Specific Scenario Analysis

### Scenario 1: Targeted Individual Campaign

An individual becomes the subject of AI-generated synthetic content campaign.

**Attack Vector:**
- Deepfake videos in compromising scenarios
- AI voice clones saying harmful things
- Synthetic social media histories
- Coordinated distribution across platforms

**Psychological Impact:**
| Phase | Duration | Effect | Intervention Window |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------------|
| Acute shock | Hours-days | Panic, disbelief | Immediate support needed |
| Social erosion | Days-weeks | Relationship damage | Reputation management |
| Identity crisis | Weeks-months | Self-concept disruption | Mental health treatment |
| Chronic effects | Months-years | PTSD, anxiety disorders | Long-term therapy |

### Scenario 2: Mass Confusion Event

Large-scale release of synthetic content creating collective uncertainty about major event.

**Cascade Dynamics:**
```
Synthetic content released → Initial confusion
                         → Conflicting "evidence" proliferates
                         → Authoritative sources questioned
                         → Social media amplification
                         → Polarization of interpretation
                         → Violence between factions
```

**Historical Analogs:**
- Rwanda radio-driven genocide (information as weapon)
- COVID misinformation impacts (health behavior cascades)
- Election interference effects (democratic legitimacy erosion)

### Scenario 3: AI Companion Dependency Cascade

Widespread reliance on AI companions leads to social skill atrophy and isolation.

**Progression:**
| Stage | Timeframe | Characteristics | Reversibility |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Initial adoption | 0-6 months | Supplementary use | High |
| Primary preference | 6-18 months | Human interaction avoidance | Moderate |
| Dependency | 18-36 months | Atrophied social skills | Low |
| Isolation | 3+ years | Near-complete withdrawal | Very low |

## System-Level Effects

### Trust Erosion Dynamics

```
Evidence authenticity uncertain → Defensive skepticism
                              → Conspiracy theory adoption
                              → Institutional legitimacy decline
                              → Social cohesion weakening
                              → Democratic function impairment
```

### Mental Health System Impact

| Effect | Timeline | Severity | Current Preparedness |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------------|
| Increased caseload | 1-3 years | Moderate | Low |
| Novel presentation types | 2-5 years | Moderate | Very low |
| Treatment complexity | 3-7 years | High | Very low |
| System overwhelm | 5-10 years | High | Minimal |

## Intervention Points

### Individual Level
1. **Media literacy training** - Synthetic content recognition
2. **Mental health support** - Expanded access for affected individuals
3. **Social connection programs** - Counter isolation tendencies

### Platform Level
1. **Synthetic content labeling** - Mandatory disclosure
2. **Distribution limits** - Velocity caps on novel content
3. **Harm prevention** - Proactive detection of targeted campaigns

### Institutional Level
1. **Rapid response capability** - Coordinated debunking
2. **Authentication infrastructure** - Verified content channels
3. **Research investment** - Understanding emerging harms

## Model Uncertainties

### Major Unknowns

| Factor | Nature of Uncertainty | Research Needed |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Resilience factors | What makes populations/individuals resilient? | Longitudinal studies |
| Threshold effects | When do individual harms become collective? | Epidemiological modeling |
| Intervention efficacy | What actually helps? | Randomized trials |
| Long-term adaptation | Will populations adapt? | Extended observation |

### Key Cruxes

**For "high concern" conclusion:**
- Synthetic content becomes indistinguishable from real (likely by 2026-2028)
- Mental health systems remain underfunded
- Platform interventions remain voluntary and weak
- Vulnerable populations lack support networks

**For "moderate concern" conclusion:**
- Detection technology keeps pace
- Public awareness and resilience increases
- Regulatory frameworks emerge
- Mental health investment increases

## Limitations

1. **Limited empirical data** - Large-scale AI-driven psychological harms are nascent
2. **Cultural variation** - Vulnerability factors vary significantly across populations
3. **Attacker sophistication** - Model may underestimate adversarial creativity
4. **Positive adaptation** - May underestimate human and societal resilience
5. **Technical evolution** - Both harmful capabilities and defenses are rapidly changing

## Conclusions

The cyber psychosis cascade model suggests:

1. **Individual targeting** is already feasible and documented
2. **Mass confusion events** are increasingly possible
3. **Dependency cascades** are emerging but slow-moving
4. **Institutional preparedness** is critically low
5. **Intervention windows** exist but are narrowing

The most critical uncertainty is whether defensive measures (detection, authentication, mental health support) can scale faster than offensive capabilities (synthetic content generation, personalized targeting).
