## Overview

AI safety research requires talent, compute, and funding - all scarce resources with alternative uses. How these resources get allocated across academic, industry, and government sectors significantly shapes which problems get worked on, what methods are used, and who controls the resulting knowledge.

**Central question:** Is the current allocation of safety research resources optimal for reducing AI risk, and what interventions could improve it?

## The Resource Landscape

### Current Allocation (Estimates, 2024-2025)

| Sector | Annual Funding | Researchers (FTE) | Compute Access | Share of Total |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **AI Labs** | $500M-1B | 500-1000 | Very High | 60-70% |
| **Academia** | $100-200M | 300-500 | Low-Medium | 15-20% |
| **Government** | $50-100M | 50-100 | Medium | 5-10% |
| **Nonprofits** | $50-100M | 100-200 | Low | 5-10% |

**Key observation:** Industry dominates safety research resources, mirroring the broader AI field.

### Resource Types

**Talent:**
- PhD-level researchers with relevant expertise
- Bottleneck: Very limited supply
- Concentration: SF Bay Area, London, few other hubs
- Flow: Academia -> Industry (brain drain)

**Compute:**
- GPU clusters for experiments
- Bottleneck: Cost and access
- Concentration: Labs and cloud providers
- Flow: Industry hoards, academia starved

**Funding:**
- Research grants, salaries, infrastructure
- Bottleneck: Decision-maker expertise
- Concentration: Labs and major foundations
- Flow: Increasing, but still small relative to capabilities

**Data:**
- Model access for study
- Bottleneck: Proprietary systems
- Concentration: Labs control access
- Flow: Limited sharing for safety research

## Academic vs. Industry

### Academic Safety Research

**Strengths:**
- Independence from commercial pressure
- Longer time horizons
- Theoretical depth
- Publication and openness norms
- Training pipeline for future researchers

**Weaknesses:**
- Limited compute access
- Brain drain to industry
- Slow pace of publication
- May lack access to frontier systems
- Funding uncertainty

**Examples:**
- Center for Human-Compatible AI (Berkeley)
- Stanford HAI
- MIT FutureTech
- Oxford Future of Humanity Institute

### Industry Safety Research

**Strengths:**
- Access to frontier systems
- Massive compute resources
- Attracts top talent with compensation
- Can implement findings directly

- Potential conflicts of interest
- Less theoretical depth

**Examples:**
- Anthropic (highest safety/capabilities ratio)
- OpenAI Safety
- Google DeepMind Safety
- Meta FAIR (less safety-focused)

### The Brain Drain Problem

**Dynamics:**
```
High industry salaries -> Top talent leaves academia ->
Less academic mentorship -> Fewer future researchers ->
Weaker academic field -> More dependence on industry
```

**Salary differentials:**
- Academic assistant professor: $100-150k
- Industry researcher: $300-500k+
- Industry senior researcher: $500k-2M+

**Effects:**
1. Fewer independent researchers
2. Training pipeline weakened
3. Industry sets research agenda
4. Conflicts of interest unavoidable

## Government Role

### Current Government Involvement
