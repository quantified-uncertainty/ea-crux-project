## Overview

Different AI risks require different capability levels to become dangerous. A system that can write convincing phishing emails poses different risks than one that can autonomously discover zero-day vulnerabilities. This model maps specific capability requirements to specific risks, helping predict when risks activate as capabilities improve.

## Capability Dimensions

AI capabilities are not monolithic. We track several key dimensions:

### 1. Domain Knowledge

How much factual and procedural knowledge the system has in specific domains.

**Levels:**
- **Undergraduate**: Textbook-level knowledge, basic procedures
- **Graduate**: Research-level understanding, specialized techniques
- **Expert**: Frontier knowledge, novel synthesis
- **Superhuman**: Knowledge beyond any individual human

### 2. Reasoning Depth

How many steps of logical/causal reasoning the system can perform reliably.

**Levels:**
- **Simple**: 2-3 step inferences
- **Moderate**: 5-10 step chains
- **Complex**: 20+ step reasoning with branching
- **Superhuman**: Arbitrarily deep reliable reasoning

### 3. Planning Horizon

How far ahead the system can plan and maintain coherent goals.

**Levels:**
- **Immediate**: Single step, reactive
- **Short-term**: Minutes to hours
- **Medium-term**: Days to weeks
- **Long-term**: Months to years

### 4. Strategic Modeling

Ability to model other agents and environments strategically.

**Levels:**
- **None**: No explicit modeling
- **Basic**: Simple predictions
- **Sophisticated**: Multi-level modeling (I think they think...)
- **Superhuman**: Accurate predictions of complex systems

### 5. Autonomous Execution

Ability to execute multi-step tasks without human guidance.

**Levels:**
- **None**: Requires step-by-step instruction
- **Simple**: Can complete well-defined subtasks
- **Complex**: Can handle multi-hour tasks with ambiguity
- **Full**: Can operate indefinitely without human intervention

## Threshold Dynamics

### Why Thresholds Matter

Many risks have **threshold dynamics** rather than gradual scaling:

1. **Skill barriers**: Before a capability level, the system cannot perform the task at all; after, it can
2. **Economic barriers**: Before, AI assistance isn't cost-effective; after, it dominates
3. **Detection barriers**: Before, AI output is distinguishable; after, it isn't

### Example: Bioweapons Threshold

```
CAPABILITY LEVEL
       │
       │              ┌─────────────────────
       │              │ Risk Zone
       │   ───────────┤ (provides meaningful uplift)
       │              │
       │   Threshold  │
       │   ░░░░░░░░░░░│░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
       │              │
       │   ───────────┼─────────────────────
       │   Below threshold
       │   (provides no meaningful uplift
       │    beyond textbooks)
       │
       └────────────────────────────────────► TIME
               2024  2025  2026  2027  2028
```

### Gradual vs. Discontinuous Activation

Some risks activate gradually:
- Economic displacement (continuous)
- Epistemic erosion (continuous)
- Attention manipulation (continuous)

Some risks activate discontinuously:
- Bioweapons uplift (threshold)
- Strategic deception (threshold)
- Authentication collapse (near-threshold)

## Uncertainty Quantification

### Capability Forecasting Uncertainty

| Forecast Horizon | Uncertainty Band |
|-----------------|------------------|
| 6 months | +/- 0.5 levels |
| 1 year | +/- 1 level |
| 2 years | +/- 1.5 levels |
| 5 years | +/- 2+ levels |

### Key Uncertainties by Risk

**Bioweapons:**
- How much domain knowledge gap remains?
- Will reasoning improvements generalize to synthesis?
- What's the minimum viable capability level?

**Scheming:**
- Can sophisticated strategic modeling emerge from scale?
- How would we detect if it has emerged?
- Is long-term planning fundamentally hard for current architectures?

**Economic Displacement:**
- What's the real autonomous execution threshold for most jobs?
- How fast will deployment follow capability?
- What economic/social barriers slow adoption?

## Monitoring Recommendations

### High-Priority Capability Signals

1. **Autonomous coding improvements** (SWE-bench scores)
   - Proxy for general autonomous execution
   - Currently ~15-25% for frontier models
   - Watch for >50% milestone

2. **Multi-step planning benchmarks**
   - Proxy for long-term planning capability
   - Track ARC-AGI and similar

3. **Specialized domain evaluations**
   - Bio/chem synthesis knowledge
   - Security vulnerability discovery
   - Track Anthropic/OpenAI eval results

4. **Self-modeling and situational awareness tests**
   - Detection of training vs. deployment
   - Accuracy of self-predictions
   - Novel test designs critical

### Measurement Gaps

Current evaluation gaps that matter for risk assessment:

| Capability | Current Eval Quality | Importance |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| Autonomous execution (hours+) | Low | Critical |
| Strategic deception | Very Low | Critical |
| Self-modeling accuracy | Low | High |
| Long-term coherent planning | Low | High |
| Real-world task completion | Medium | High |

## Implications

**Immediate actions:**
1. Implement capability evaluations that map to risk thresholds
2. Create warning systems for approaching thresholds
3. Develop mitigations before thresholds are crossed

**Ongoing:**
4. Share anonymized capability trends for safety coordination
5. Pause or slow development if approaching critical thresholds without mitigations

### For Policymakers

**Immediate:**
1. Require disclosure of capability benchmark results
2. Establish threshold-based regulation triggers
3. Fund capability evaluation infrastructure

**Longer-term:**
4. Create international capability monitoring frameworks

3. Strategic modeling and deception detection
4. Threshold identification for specific risks

## Summary

**Key insights:**
1. Different risks have different capability requirements
2. Many risks have threshold dynamics, not gradual activation
3. Current systems are 0.5-2 levels below most critical thresholds
4. Near-term capabilities (1-2 years) likely cross several thresholds
5. Long-term risks (scheming, takeover) require capabilities further out

**Highest-priority thresholds (by timeline):**
1. Authentication collapse (2025-2026)
2. Persuasion weapons (2025-2026)
3. Cyberweapon development (2025-2027)
