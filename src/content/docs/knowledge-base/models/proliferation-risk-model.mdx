## Overview

This model analyzes the diffusion of AI capabilities from frontier labs to broader populations of actors. It examines diffusion mechanisms, control points, and the relationship between proliferation speed and risk accumulation.

**Central Question:** How fast do dangerous AI capabilities spread, and where are the leverage points for control?

## Proliferation Model Framework

### The Diffusion Cascade

**Actor Tiers:**

```
Tier 1: Frontier Labs (5-10 actors)
  ↓ (6-18 months)
Tier 2: Major Tech Companies (50-100 actors)
  ↓ (12-24 months)
Tier 3: Well-Resourced Organizations (1,000-10,000 actors)
  ↓ (18-36 months)
Tier 4: Open Source / Public (millions of actors)
  ↓ (24-48 months)
Tier 5: Individuals (billions of potential actors)
```

**Time constants are decreasing:**
- 2020: 24-36 months from Tier 1 → Tier 4
- 2023: 12-18 months (ChatGPT effect)
- 2025: 6-12 months projected
- Trend: Accelerating diffusion

### Diffusion Mechanisms

**1. Publication (Knowledge Transfer)**

**Pathway:** Research → Conferences/Journals → Replication

| Mechanism | Speed | Fidelity | Controllability |
|-----------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Academic publication | 6-18 months | High | Low (norms favor openness) |
| Preprints (arXiv) | Immediate | High | Very Low |
| Conference presentations | 3-12 months | Medium | Low |
| Patents | 18-24 months | High | Medium (but public) |

**Current Status:**
- Most capability research published
- Increasing self-censorship for dangerous capabilities
- But: Competitive pressure to publish

**Control Effectiveness: Low-Medium**
- Norms can shift (some dangerous work not published)
- But: Can't unpublish; knowledge spreads
- Reverse engineering possible

**2. Open Source Release (Direct Capability Transfer)**

**Pathway:** Model → Public Repository → Download/Fine-tune

| Example | Release Date | Tier 1 → Tier 4 Time | Control Attempt |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| LLaMA 1 | Feb 2023 | &lt;1 week (leak) | Failed |
| LLaMA 2 | Jul 2023 | Immediate (intentional) | None |
| Mistral 7B | Sep 2023 | Immediate | None |
| DeepSeek R1 | Jan 2025 | Immediate | None |

**Current Status:**
- Major trend toward open release
- Motivations: Competition, ideology, ecosystem building
- Safety measures stripped rapidly (uncensored variants)

**Control Effectiveness: Very Low**
- Once released, cannot be recalled
- Fine-tuning enables customization
- Quantization enables broader access (smaller hardware requirements)

**3. API Access (Controlled Capability Transfer)**

**Pathway:** Capability → API → Gated Access

| Provider | Control Mechanism | Bypass Difficulty |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| OpenAI GPT-4 | Usage policies, monitoring | Low-Medium (jailbreaks common) |
| Anthropic Claude | Constitutional AI, screening | Low-Medium |
| Google Gemini | Safety filters | Low-Medium |

**Current Status:**
- Provides capability without proliferating weights
- But: API jailbreaks common
- And: Inference-time safety can be defeated

**Control Effectiveness: Medium**
- Better than open source
- But: Limited protection against determined actors
- And: Doesn't prevent eventual weight proliferation

**4. Talent Movement (Know-How Transfer)**

**Pathway:** Frontier Lab → Researcher Movement → New Organization

**Metrics:**
- ~30-50% of AI researchers change organizations every 2-3 years
- Rapid founding of new labs by former big-lab researchers
- Knowledge embodied in people is non-excludable

**Control Effectiveness: Very Low**
- Cannot restrict movement in free societies
- Trade secret law limited effectiveness
- Tacit knowledge travels with people

**5. Compute Accessibility (Infrastructure Transfer)**

**Pathway:** Frontier Compute → Cloud Services → Wider Access

| Compute Tier | Access Method | Cost Barrier | Control Point |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| Frontier training (100K+ GPUs) | Direct ownership | $100M-1B+ | High (very few actors) |
| Large-scale training (10K GPUs) | Cloud rental | $10M-100M | Medium (limited actors) |
| Fine-tuning (100s GPUs) | Cloud rental | $100K-1M | Low (many actors) |
| Inference (1-10 GPUs) | Consumer hardware | $1K-10K | Very Low (mass market) |

**Control Effectiveness: Medium-High (for training), Low (for inference)**
- Export controls on advanced chips (effective against some state actors)
- Cloud provider monitoring (can detect large training runs)
- But: Doesn't control proliferation after training

**6. Reverse Engineering (Capability Reconstruction)**

**Pathway:** Observed Capability → Analysis → Replication

**Examples:**
- GPT-3 → Many similar models
- AlphaFold → RoseTTAFold, OpenFold
- DALL-E → Stable Diffusion, Midjourney

**Time to Replication:**
- 2020: 18-36 months
- 2023: 12-18 months
- 2025: 6-12 months projected

**Control Effectiveness: Very Low**
- Cannot prevent reverse engineering
- Only delays proliferation

## Risk Accumulation Model

### Risk = f(Capability, Proliferation, Intent)

**Quantitative Framework:**

```
Total_Risk = Σ(Capability_level × Probability_of_access × Probability_of_misuse)

Where sum is over all actor types:
- State actors (high capability, medium-high access, low-medium misuse probability)
- Terrorist groups (medium capability, low-medium access, high misuse probability)
- Criminal organizations (medium capability, medium access, medium-high misuse probability)
- Individuals (low-medium capability, high access post-proliferation, low misuse probability)
```

**Key Insight:** Even if individual misuse probability is low, with millions of actors, expected harms increase.

### Proliferation Thresholds

**Threshold 1: Organizational Proliferation (EXCEEDED)**

**Definition:** Capability accessible to well-resourced organizations (Tier 3)

**Current Status:**
- GPT-3-level: EXCEEDED (2022)
- GPT-4-level: EXCEEDED (2024)
- Future capabilities: TBD

**Implication:**
- State actors can access
- Large criminal organizations can access
- Some terrorist groups can access

**Risk Level:** Medium-High
- Enables misuse by sophisticated actors
- Still requires resources, limits pool

**Threshold 2: Individual Proliferation (APPROACHING for some capabilities)**

**Definition:** Capability accessible to individuals with modest resources (Tier 5)

**Current Status:**
- GPT-3-level: EXCEEDED (open models, fine-tuning)
- GPT-4-level: APPROACHING (DeepSeek, others)
- Dangerous specific capabilities: Variable

**Implication:**
- Millions of potential actors
- Impossible to monitor all
- Attribution very difficult

**Risk Level:** High
- Mass potential for misuse
- Governance nearly impossible
- Weak link problem extreme

**Threshold 3: Capability Irreversibility (EXCEEDED for many capabilities)**

**Definition:** Capability proliferation cannot be reversed (open source, widespread knowledge)

**Current Status:**
- Text generation: EXCEEDED
- Image generation: EXCEEDED
- Code generation: EXCEEDED
- Protein folding: EXCEEDED
- Future dangerous capabilities: At risk

**Implication:**
- Control must be preventive, not reactive
- Once crossed, cannot go back
- Lock-in of proliferated state

**Risk Level:** Critical (for future capabilities)
- No second chances
- Irreversible decisions

## Control Point Analysis

### High-Control Points (Most Effective)

**1. Compute (Training Phase)**

**Mechanism:** Restrict access to compute needed for frontier training

**Effectiveness:** High (for now)
- Training GPT-4-class models requires 10K+ advanced GPUs
- Very few actors have this
- Choke point: Semiconductor manufacturing (highly concentrated)

**Implementation:**
- Export controls on advanced chips (U.S., others)
- Cloud provider monitoring (detect large training runs)
- Chip-level governance (usage tracking)

**Limitations:**
- Compute efficiency improving (lowers barrier over time)
- China developing domestic chip industry
- Doesn't control inference
- Doesn't prevent proliferation after training

**Durability:** Medium (5-10 years before likely circumvention)

**2. Model Weights Security (Post-Training)**

**Mechanism:** Prevent unauthorized access to trained model weights

**Effectiveness:** Medium-High (if implemented well)
- Weights are the "compiled capability"
- Small files (can be secured like classified information)
- Theft/leak single point of failure

**Implementation:**
- Cybersecurity for model storage
- Insider threat mitigation
- Leak response plans

**Limitations:**
- Single breach = irreversible proliferation
- Insider access necessary for operation
- Eventual open-source equivalents likely

**Durability:** Low-Medium (leak probability accumulates over time)

**3. Pre-Publication Review (Knowledge Phase)**

**Mechanism:** Review dangerous capability research before publication

**Effectiveness:** Medium
- Can delay proliferation
- Allows time for countermeasures
- Preserves surprise advantage for defenders

**Implementation:**
- Voluntary self-governance (current, weak)
- Institutional review boards (possible)
- Government classification (existing for some areas)

**Limitations:**
- Chills research and collaboration
- Hard to define "dangerous"
- International coordination needed
- Can't prevent independent discovery

**Durability:** Medium (if norms hold)

### Medium-Control Points

**4. API Access Controls (Deployment Phase)**

**Mechanism:** Provide capability through controlled interfaces, not model weights

**Effectiveness:** Medium
- Enables usage monitoring
- Allows intervention on misuse
- Preserves capability concentration

**Implementation:**
- Usage policies and monitoring (current)
- Know-your-customer requirements
- Rate limiting, filtering

**Limitations:**
- Jailbreaks common
- Doesn't prevent weight proliferation
- Economic pressure to open access

**Durability:** Low-Medium (circumvention frequent)

**5. Capability Evaluation and Red-Teaming (Assessment Phase)**

**Mechanism:** Identify dangerous capabilities before deployment

**Effectiveness:** Medium
- Can inform decision whether to deploy
- Identifies risks proactively
- Enables targeted controls

**Implementation:**
- Internal red teams (current, variable quality)
- Independent audits (proposed)
- Mandatory evaluations (proposed policy)

**Limitations:**
- Doesn't prevent proliferation, only informs
- May miss capabilities
- Evaluation itself may be revealing

**Durability:** Medium (as early-warning system)

### Low-Control Points

**6. Post-Proliferation Monitoring (After Spread)**

**Mechanism:** Detect and respond to misuse after capabilities spread

**Effectiveness:** Low
- Too many actors to monitor
- Attribution difficult
- Reactive, not preventive

**Implementation:**
- Law enforcement (traditional)
- Platform monitoring (limited)
- Cyber defenses

**Limitations:**
- Overwhelmed by scale
- Harms occur before intervention
- Privacy concerns with mass surveillance

**Durability:** Low (gets worse with proliferation)

## Diffusion Speed Analysis

   - DeepSeek: GPT-4-level at 1/10th training cost
   - Lowers barrier to replication

3. **Ideological Commitment**
   - Open-source movement strong in AI community
   - "AI should be open" as value

4. **Economic Incentives**
   - Ecosystems built on open models
   - Customer demand for open alternatives

5. **Geopolitical Dynamics**
   - States want domestic capabilities
   - Reduces dependence on U.S. companies

### Factors Slowing Diffusion

1. **Safety Norms (Weak)**
   - Some self-censorship on dangerous capabilities
   - But: Inconsistent, not enforced

2. **Compute Barriers (Eroding)**
   - Frontier training still expensive
   - But: Efficiency improving
