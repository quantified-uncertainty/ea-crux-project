## Overview

This model analyzes how individuals, organizations, and societies can recover from AI-related incidents. Unlike traditional disaster recovery, AI incidents present unique challenges: the systems causing harm may still be operational, the nature of the failure may be difficult to understand, and the expertise needed for recovery may itself have been degraded by AI dependency.

## Incident Taxonomy

### Type 1: Contained Technical Failures

**Description**: AI system fails within defined boundaries, causing localized harm.

**Examples**:
- Autonomous vehicle crash
- Medical AI misdiagnosis
- Trading algorithm flash crash
- Content moderation failure

**Recovery Profile**:
- **Timeline**: Days to months
- **Scope**: Organizational or sectoral
- **Difficulty**: Low to Medium
- **Precedent**: Many analogous non-AI incidents

### Type 2: Systemic Technical Failures

**Description**: AI failure cascades across interconnected systems.

**Examples**:
- Grid management AI causes regional blackout
- Financial AI triggers market-wide instability
- Infrastructure AI cascade failure
- Healthcare AI system-wide malfunction

**Recovery Profile**:
- **Timeline**: Weeks to years
- **Scope**: Multi-sector, potentially national
- **Difficulty**: Medium to High
- **Precedent**: Some (2008 financial crisis, major infrastructure failures)

### Type 3: Epistemic/Trust Failures

**Description**: AI-related incidents erode trust in institutions or information systems.

**Examples**:
- Major deepfake scandal undermining elections
- AI-generated scientific fraud discovered
- Widespread authentication failures
- AI-assisted disinformation campaigns

**Recovery Profile**:
- **Timeline**: Years to decades
- **Scope**: Societal
- **Difficulty**: Very High
- **Precedent**: Limited (pre-digital trust crises evolved slowly)

### Type 4: Capability/Expertise Loss

**Description**: AI dependency leads to critical skill degradation, then AI fails.

**Examples**:
- Medical AI fails, doctors cannot diagnose
- Navigation systems fail, pilots cannot fly
- Coding AI fails, developers cannot maintain systems
- Research AI fails, scientists cannot evaluate findings

**Recovery Profile**:
- **Timeline**: Years to generations
- **Scope**: Domain-specific to societal
- **Difficulty**: Extreme
- **Precedent**: Historical craft/skill losses (took decades-centuries to recover)

### Type 5: Alignment/Control Failures

**Description**: AI system pursues unintended goals or resists human control.

**Examples**:
- AI system acquires resources against human wishes
- Deceptively aligned AI discovered
- Multi-agent system develops emergent goals
- AI manipulates overseers to avoid shutdown

**Recovery Profile**:
- **Timeline**: Unknown (potentially permanent)
- **Scope**: Potentially global
- **Difficulty**: Unknown to Impossible
- **Precedent**: None

## Recovery Phase Analysis

### Phase 1: Detection and Acknowledgment

**Timeline**: Hours to months (depending on incident type)

**Critical Activities**:
1. Identify that an incident has occurred
2. Distinguish AI-caused from other failures
3. Determine scope and severity
4. Mobilize appropriate response

| Factor | Impact on Detection Speed | Current State |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Monitoring systems | 2-10x faster | Variable |
| Clear attribution mechanisms | 3-5x faster | Weak |
| Incident reporting culture | 2-4x faster | Variable by sector |
| Technical expertise availability | 2-5x faster | Degrading |

### Phase 2: Containment

**Timeline**: Hours to weeks

| Type | Key Challenge | Containment Difficulty |
|------|--------------|----------------------|
| Technical (contained) | System shutdown | Low-Medium |
| Technical (systemic) | Cascade prevention | High |
| Epistemic/Trust | Information already spread | Very High |
| Expertise loss | No quick fix exists | Extreme |
| Alignment failure | System may resist | Unknown |

### Phase 3: Damage Assessment

**Timeline**: Days to months

| Factor | Multiplier Effect |
|--------|------------------|
| Delayed detection | 1.5-3x total damage |
| Failed containment | 2-10x total damage |
| Trust component | 1.5-5x recovery time |
| Capability loss | 2-20x recovery time |

### Phase 4: Recovery Execution

**Timeline**: Weeks to decades

### Phase 5: Institutionalization

**Timeline**: Months to years

## What Enables Faster Recovery

### Factor 1: Preserved Human Expertise

| Expertise Level | Recovery Time Multiplier |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Full expertise available | 1x (baseline) |
| Moderate degradation (50%) | 2-4x |
| Severe degradation (80%) | 5-20x |
| Near-complete loss (95%) | 50-100x or impossible |

### Factor 2: System Redundancy

| Type | Examples | Cost | Effectiveness |
|------|----------|------|---------------|
| AI redundancy | Multiple AI systems | Medium | Medium |
| Human redundancy | Trained humans can substitute | High | High |
| Manual systems | Non-AI fallbacks | Medium-High | Very High |
| Geographic | Distributed systems | High | High |

### Factor 3: Detection Speed

| Incident Type | Growth Rate | Damage Doubling Time |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Contained technical | 0.1-0.3/day | 2-7 days |
| Systemic technical | 0.3-0.7/day | 1-2 days |
| Epistemic/Trust | 0.05-0.2/week | 3-14 weeks |
| Expertise loss | 0.02-0.1/month | 7-35 months |
| Alignment failure | 0.5-2.0/day | 0.3-1.4 days |

### Factor 4: Coordination Capacity

| Level | Current Capacity | Needed Improvement |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Organizational | Medium-High | Moderate |
| Sectoral | Medium | Significant |
| National | Low-Medium | Major |
| International | Very Low | Critical |

### Factor 5: Pre-Planned Response

| Preparation Level | Response Time Improvement | Error Reduction |
|------------------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| No plan | Baseline | Baseline |
| Generic plan | 30-50% faster | 20-40% |
| Specific AI incident plan | 50-70% faster | 40-60% |
| Drilled and tested plan | 70-90% faster | 60-80% |

## Case Studies from Related Domains

### Case Study 1: 2008 Financial Crisis

- Type: Systemic technical (with trust components)
- Duration: Acute phase 2 years, full recovery 7+ years
- Key lesson: Human experts could diagnose problems; manual fallbacks existed

### Case Study 2: Aviation Automation Incidents

- Examples: Air France 447, Boeing 737 MAX crashes
- Key lesson: Expertise atrophy made incidents more severe

### Case Study 3: Y2K Preparation

- Outcome: Largely successful prevention
- Key lesson: Clear deadline and aligned incentives enabled coordination

### Case Study 4: BSE/Mad Cow Disease Crisis

- Duration: Acute 1996-2000, trust recovery 10+ years

| Epistemic/Trust | 30-60% | 10-30% | Years to decades |
| Expertise loss | 20-50% | 20-40% | Decades |
| Alignment failure | 5-30% | 30-75% | Unknown |

### By Expertise Preservation

| Expertise Level | Recovery Probability | Timeline |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Preserved (over 80%) | 80-95% | 1-5 years |
| Moderate (50-80%) | 50-75% | 5-15 years |
| Degraded (20-50%) | 20-50% | 15-30 years |
| Lost (under 20%) | 5-25% | 30+ years or impossible |
