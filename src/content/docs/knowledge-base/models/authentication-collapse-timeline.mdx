## Overview

This model projects when AI-generated content capabilities will cross thresholds that make digital authentication effectively impossible. Unlike gradual degradation, authentication collapse exhibits threshold dynamics—systems work until they suddenly don't.

## Key Thresholds

### Threshold 1: Detection Parity
**Definition**: AI-generated content becomes indistinguishable from human-created content to automated detection systems.

**Current status**: Crossed for text (2023), approaching for images (2024-2025)

**Detection accuracy**:
- Text (GPT-4 level): ~50% (random chance)
- Images (DALL-E 3, Midjourney v6): ~65-70% (declining)
- Audio (voice cloning): ~60-75% (declining rapidly)
- Video (deepfakes): ~70-80% (declining)

**Projection**: Fully crossed for all modalities by 2026-2028

### Threshold 2: Expert Detection Failure
**Definition**: Human experts cannot reliably distinguish synthetic from authentic content.

**Current status**: Partially crossed for text, approaching for images

**Expert accuracy**:
- Text: 60-70% (vs. 50% baseline)
- Images: 75-85% (declining 5-10% annually)
- Audio: 70-80% (declining)
- Video: 80-90% (for now)

**Projection**: Crossed for all modalities by 2027-2030

**Critical insight**: Expert accuracy converging toward baseline at 5-10%/year rate

### Threshold 3: Watermark Defeat
**Definition**: Watermarking and provenance systems can be reliably stripped or circumvented.

**Current status**: Already crossed for most watermarking schemes

**Removal difficulty**:
- Image watermarks: Trivial (software freely available)
- Text watermarks: Easy (paraphrasing)
- Audio watermarks: Easy (re-encoding)
- Cryptographic watermarks: Medium (but not widely deployed)

**Projection**: Effective watermark removal universal by 2025-2027

### Threshold 4: Provenance System Failure
**Definition**: End-to-end provenance (creation → distribution) cannot be guaranteed.

**Current status**: Not yet crossed (provenance systems not widely deployed)

**Failure mechanisms**:
- Camera/device compromise
- Editing that preserves provenance
- Social engineering
- Jurisdiction shopping

**Projection**: If deployed, compromised by 2028-2032

### Threshold 5: Legal Evidence Inadmissibility
**Definition**: Courts cannot accept digital evidence as reliable.

**Current status**: Not yet crossed, but pressure building

**Legal threshold**:
- Civil cases: Preponderance of evidence (>50% reliability)
- Criminal cases: Beyond reasonable doubt (~95%+ reliability)

**Projection**: Civil threshold crossed 2027-2030, criminal threshold 2030-2035

## Timeline Projections

### Scenario A: Rapid Collapse (Probability: 25-35%)

**Characteristics**:
- AI capabilities advance faster than defenses
- No effective governance
- Market incentives favor generation over detection

| Year | Milestone | Implications |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025 | Text detection fails completely | Written evidence unreliable |
| 2026 | Image detection falls below 60% | Photo/document authentication crisis |
| 2027 | Audio detection fails | Voice verification impossible |
| 2028 | Video detection below 60% | Visual evidence unreliable |
| 2029 | All digital evidence presumed fake | Legal/institutional crisis |
| 2030 | Authentication collapse complete | Digital dark age begins |

**Triggering factors**:
- Open-source models match frontier (no guardrails)
- Watermarking not adopted universally
- Detection research defunded
- Adversarial tooling proliferates

### Scenario B: Gradual Degradation (Probability: 40-50%)

**Characteristics**:
- Detection keeps pace partially
- Some defensive measures succeed
- Verification becomes expensive, not impossible

| Year | Milestone | Implications |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025 | Text detection fails for consumer tools | Specialized tools still work |
| 2027 | Image detection requires expert analysis | Verification costly |
| 2029 | Audio detection probabilistic only | Voice ID unreliable |
| 2031 | Video detection requires forensic resources | Most video unverifiable |
| 2035 | Digital evidence requires extensive verification | System stressed but functional |

**Sustaining factors**:
- Well-funded detection research
- Partial watermarking adoption
- Legal requirements for verification
- High-stakes domains invest heavily

### Scenario C: Defensive Success (Probability: 15-25%)

**Characteristics**:
- Hardware attestation deployed at scale
- Strong governance of generative AI
- Detection research well-funded

| Year | Milestone | Implications |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 2025 | Text detection fails, but watermarking deployed | Verification possible for cooperative content |
| 2027 | Hardware attestation in major devices | Authenticated content chain established |
| 2029 | C2PA widely adopted | Provenance available for most content |
| 2032 | Hybrid verification ecosystem | Authenticated + probabilistic verification |
| 2035+ | Stable verification regime | Authentication evolved but functional |

**Required actions**:
- Universal watermarking standards by 2026
- Hardware attestation in 80%+ devices by 2028
- International cooperation on verification standards
- Well-resourced detection research

### Scenario D: Catastrophic Collapse (Probability: 5-10%)

**Characteristics**:
- Sudden breakthrough in generation
- Coordinated attack on verification infrastructure
- Black swan event

| Event | Impact | Recovery Time |
|-------|--------|---------------|
| **Generation breakthrough** | All detection methods fail simultaneously | 2-5 years |
| **Coordinated deepfake attack** | Institutional trust collapses | 5-10 years |
| **Verification infrastructure attack** | Authentication systems compromised | 1-3 years |

## Arms Race Dynamics

### Generation vs. Detection

**Asymmetric warfare**:

| Factor | Generator Advantage | Magnitude |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Cost asymmetry** | Generate: $0.01, Detect: $1-100 | 100-10,000x |
| **Time asymmetry** | Generate: seconds, Detect: minutes-hours | 100-1000x |
| **Success asymmetry** | Generator needs one success, Detector must catch all | Infinite |
| **Training asymmetry** | Generator trains on future data, Detector cannot | N/A |

**Mathematical model**:

Let $G(t)$ = Generator capability, $D(t)$ = Detector capability

$$
\frac{dG}{dt} = \alpha_G \cdot \text{Compute}(t) + \beta_G \cdot D(t)
$$

$$
\frac{dD}{dt} = \alpha_D \cdot \text{Research}(t) - \beta_D \cdot (G(t) - D(t))
$$

Where:
- $\alpha_G$ = Rate of generation improvement from compute
- $\beta_G$ = Rate generators improve by learning from detectors
- $\alpha_D$ = Rate of detection improvement from research
- $\beta_D$ = Rate detectors fall behind generators

**Key insight**: $\beta_G > \beta_D$ (generators learn from detectors faster than vice versa)

**Equilibrium**: No stable equilibrium exists. Either:
1. Detection far ahead (requires massive resource advantage)
2. Generation far ahead (authentication collapse)

**Current trajectory**: Moving toward (2) as of 2024

### Detection Accuracy Decay

**Empirical model** based on observed trends (2020-2024):

$$
A(t) = A_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t} + A_{min}
$$

Where:
- $A(t)$ = Detection accuracy at time $t$
- $A_0$ = Initial accuracy (~90% in 2020)
- $\lambda$ = Decay rate (0.15-0.25 per year)
- $A_{min}$ = Minimum accuracy (~50% random chance)
- $t$ = Years since 2020

**Projections**:
- 2025: ~60-70% accuracy
- 2027: ~55-60% accuracy
- 2030: ~50-55% accuracy (approaching random)

**Half-life**: Detection accuracy loses half its value above baseline every 2.8-4.6 years
