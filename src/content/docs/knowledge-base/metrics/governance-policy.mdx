## Overview

Governance and policy metrics track the **institutional response** to AI development—from legislative frameworks to enforcement actions to international agreements. These indicators help assess whether governance is keeping pace with technological progress.

**Key Questions:**
- How many jurisdictions have binding AI laws?
- Are regulations being enforced effectively?
- Is international coordination increasing?
- Are safety considerations reflected in government budgets?

## 6. Export Control Effectiveness

### Regulatory Framework (2024-2025)
- **October 2022:** Initial advanced computing export controls
- **October 2023:** Expanded controls
- **April 2024:** Further expansions
- **December 2024:** 140 companies added to Entity List; FDPR expansion
- **January 2025:** AI Diffusion Framework + Foundry Due Diligence Rule
  - **Three-tier system:** Tier 1 (allies, minimal restrictions) | Tier 2 (others, limited) | Tier 3 (adversaries, strict)
  - **Scheduled implementation:** May 15, 2025 (later suspended/revised)

### Enforcement Challenges
- **Nvidia workaround:** Continued providing "slightly lower-performance chips" with "nearly comparable AI model training capability"
- **Chinese stockpiling:** Aggressive pre-restriction purchasing (especially before May 2025)
- **Huawei adaptation:**
  - 2019: Ascend 910 (TSMC Taiwan)
  - 2022: 910B (mainland China production)
  - 2025: 910c expected to match Nvidia H100 at 60-70% cost

### Effectiveness Assessment
- **BIS acknowledgment:** Not expecting "successful enforcement compliance by Chinese firms operating in China"
- **Estimated blocked percentage:** Not publicly disclosed
- **Policy volatility:** Diffusion Rule rescinded/suspended in late 2025; replacement pending

**Current assessment:** Export controls show **moderate effectiveness**—they delay but do not prevent adversary access. Enforcement gaps and workarounds persist.

## 8. Time from AI Incident to Regulatory Response

### Case Study: ChatGPT

| Incident/Event | Date | Regulatory Response | Time Lag |
|----------------|------|---------------------|----------|
| **ChatGPT launch** | Nov 30, 2022 | - | - |
| **Privacy/GDPR concerns** | Early 2023 | Italy temporary ban | **~4 months** |
| **Italy ban** | March 2023 | OpenAI GDPR compliance | **3 weeks** (ban lifted) |
| **Broad availability** | 2023 | Biden EO 14110 | **~10 months** (Oct 2023) |
| **ChatGPT data incident** | March 2023 | Investigation launched | **Days to weeks** |
| **Nonsensical answers bug** | 2024 | OpenAI self-remediation | **Hours** (no regulatory action) |

## Data Quality and Limitations

### High-Quality Metrics
✓ **Countries with binding legislation:** Well-documented through legal databases
✓ **International agreements:** Public treaties and declarations
✓ **Major enforcement actions:** Disclosed by regulators (SEC, FTC, DPAs)
✓ **Framework adoption (NIST/ISO):** Tracked by issuing organizations

### Moderate-Quality Metrics
⚠ **Government budgets:** Federal budgets public, but AI-specific line items often bundled
⚠ **Regulatory response times:** Case studies available, but not systematically tracked
⚠ **Standards adoption rates:** Self-reported or certification-based (may undercount)

### Low-Quality/Unavailable Metrics
✗ **Regulatory staff headcount:** Rarely disclosed publicly; structural roles described instead
✗ **Export control effectiveness:** Success rates classified; only workarounds visible
✗ **Comprehensive enforcement counts:** Many actions settled confidentially

---

## Key Trends (2024-2025)

1. **Regulatory acceleration:** US federal regulations doubled 2023→2024; state activity up 3.6x
2. **EU global leadership:** First comprehensive binding framework; becoming de facto global standard
3. **Enforcement emerging:** Still mostly under existing law (consumer protection, privacy), not AI-specific
4. **International coordination increasing:** First binding treaty signed; 90+ countries with strategies
5. **Standards rapid adoption:** 5,200+ orgs on NIST framework; 2,847 ISO certifications
6. **Implementation gap:** Only 1 jurisdiction (EU) with comprehensive binding law; 32+ with partial/sector laws
7. **Audit requirements nascent:** EU leading; most countries voluntary or sector-specific only
