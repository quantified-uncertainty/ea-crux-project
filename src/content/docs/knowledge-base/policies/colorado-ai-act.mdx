## Overview

The Colorado AI Act (SB 21-205) is the **first comprehensive AI regulation enacted by a US state**. Signed into law on May 17, 2024, it takes effect February 1, 2026.

Unlike California's vetoed SB 1047 which focused on frontier models, Colorado's law targets **high-risk AI systems** that make consequential decisions about individuals—similar to the EU AI Act's approach.

## Scope: High-Risk AI Systems

The law applies to AI systems used to make **consequential decisions** in areas including:

- **Employment**: Hiring, firing, promotion, compensation
- **Education**: Admissions, assessments, discipline
- **Financial Services**: Lending, insurance, credit
- **Housing**: Rental applications, property transactions
- **Healthcare**: Treatment recommendations, coverage decisions
- **Legal Services**: Case assessment, sentencing recommendations
- **Government Services**: Benefits, licensing, permits

## Key Requirements

### For Developers

Developers of high-risk AI systems must:

1. **Provide documentation** to deployers including:
   - Intended uses and known limitations
   - Data used for training
   - Known risks of algorithmic discrimination
   - How the system was evaluated

2. **Publish transparency reports** on their website describing:
   - Types of high-risk systems developed
   - Risk management practices
   - How they address algorithmic discrimination

### For Deployers

Organizations using high-risk AI systems must:

1. **Implement risk management programs** including:
   - Regular impact assessments
   - Human oversight procedures
   - Employee training

2. **Provide consumer disclosures** when AI is used to make consequential decisions

3. **Allow appeals** when AI contributes to adverse decisions

4. **Report discrimination** discovered in AI systems to the Attorney General

### Algorithmic Discrimination

Central to the law is preventing **algorithmic discrimination**—when AI systems contribute to differential treatment based on:
- Race, color, ethnicity, national origin
- Religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity
- Disability, age, veteran status

## Enforcement

- **Attorney General** has exclusive enforcement authority
- **Civil penalties** up to $20,000 per violation
- **Affirmative defense** available for developers/deployers with good compliance programs
- **No private right of action** (individuals cannot sue directly)

## Comparison with Other Approaches

| Feature | Colorado | California SB 1047 | EU AI Act |
|---------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Focus | High-risk decisions | Frontier models | Both |
| Status | Enacted | Vetoed | In force |
| Threshold | Consequential decisions | Compute/cost | Risk tiers |
| Discrimination | Central focus | Not primary | Included |

## Reception

**Supporters argue:**
- Addresses real harms from AI in everyday decisions
- Manageable compliance burden
- Protects vulnerable populations

**Critics argue:**
- May stifle innovation in Colorado
- Compliance costs burden small businesses
- Unclear definitions create uncertainty

## Significance

Colorado's law is significant because it:

1. **Demonstrates state-level AI regulation is possible** in the US
2. **Focuses on discrimination** rather than catastrophic risk
3. **Provides a template** other states may follow
4. **Shows the EU AI Act's influence** on US policy thinking
