Technical safety research aims to develop methods, tools, and frameworks for building AI systems that are safe, interpretable, and aligned with human values.

## Research Areas

### Alignment Research
- [RLHF and Value Learning](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/rlhf/) - Training AI on human preferences
- [Scalable Oversight](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/scalable-oversight/) - Supervising superhuman AI
- [Corrigibility](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/corrigibility/) - Ensuring AI can be corrected

### Interpretability
- [Mechanistic Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/interpretability/) - Understanding AI internals
- [AI-Assisted Interpretability](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/ai-assisted/) - Using AI to understand AI

### Safety Evaluation
- [Evaluations](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/evals/) - Testing for dangerous capabilities
- [AI Control](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/ai-control/) - Containing AI systems

### Research Agendas
- [Research Agendas Comparison](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/research-agendas/) - Different approaches to alignment
- [Agent Foundations](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/agent-foundations/) - Theoretical foundations
- [Multi-Agent Safety](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/multi-agent/) - Safety in multi-agent settings

## Key Organizations

Technical safety research is conducted at:
- Frontier labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind safety teams)
- Independent research organizations (MIRI, ARC, Redwood Research)
- Academic institutions (CHAI, CAIS)
