## Summary

Scalable oversight addresses a fundamental challenge: How can humans supervise AI systems on tasks where humans can't directly evaluate the AI's output?

As AI systems become more capable, they will work on problems where:
- The solution is too complex for humans to verify
- The reasoning is beyond human comprehension
- The consequences are too difficult to predict

We need oversight methods that scale with AI capability.

## The Core Problem

### Current Approach: RLHF
Human evaluators rate AI outputs, and we train models to produce highly-rated outputs.

### The Scaling Problem
This fails when:
- Outputs require expert knowledge to evaluate
- Correctness requires checking many steps
- AI can produce convincing but wrong outputs
- Evaluators can be manipulated

### Example
An AI proves a mathematical theorem. The proof is 10,000 pages. How does a human verify it?

## Proposed Solutions

### Debate
Two AI systems argue opposing positions; humans judge the debate:
- Each AI tries to expose flaws in the other's argument
- Humans only need to judge convincing arguments, not verify directly
- Theoretically: truth has an advantage in adversarial debate

### Recursive Reward Modeling
Decompose hard tasks into easier subtasks:
- AI breaks complex question into simpler questions
- Humans evaluate the simple questions
- Answers propagate up to solve the original question

### Market-Based Approaches
Use prediction markets or other mechanisms to aggregate evaluations across many humans and AI systems.

### AI-Assisted Evaluation
Use AI systems to help humans evaluate:
- AI critiques other AI's work
- AI explains complex reasoning
- AI highlights potential problems

### Process-Based Supervision
Evaluate reasoning process, not just outcomes:
- Reward good reasoning steps
- Penalize suspicious reasoning patterns
- Avoid optimizing solely for final output

## Key Challenges

### Deceptive AI
If the AI is trying to deceive:
- It may produce convincing but wrong arguments
- It may sabotage debate opponents unfairly
- It may game process-based supervision

### Evaluation Difficulty
Some tasks may be inherently hard to evaluate:
- Creative tasks with subjective quality
- Long-horizon predictions
- Novel domains without ground truth

### Decomposition Limits
Not all tasks decompose naturally:
- Holistic reasoning
- Intuitive judgments
- Emergent properties

## Current Research

### Empirical Work
- Debate experiments on constrained tasks
- Recursive reward modeling studies
- Process supervision for math

### Theoretical Work
- Computational complexity of scalable oversight
- Adversarial dynamics analysis
- Information-theoretic limits
