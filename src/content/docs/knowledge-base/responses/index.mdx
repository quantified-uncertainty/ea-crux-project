## Response Categories

### Technical Responses

Direct work on making AI systems safer:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Technical Approaches](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/)** | Alignment research, interpretability, evaluations, AI control |
| **[Research Agendas](/knowledge-base/responses/technical/research-agendas/)** | Specific research programs and their theories of change |

### Governance Responses

Policy, regulation, and coordination:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Legislation](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/legislation/)** | Enacted and proposed laws (EU AI Act, US EO, etc.) |
| **[Policy Approaches](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/policy-approaches/)** | Mechanisms like compute governance, export controls |
| **[International](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/international/)** | Summits, treaties, and international coordination |
| **[Industry Self-Regulation](/knowledge-base/responses/governance/industry/)** | RSPs, voluntary commitments, industry standards |

### Institutions

Organizations and bodies working on AI governance:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[AI Safety Institutes](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/)** | Government bodies focused on AI safety |
| **[Standards Bodies](/knowledge-base/responses/institutions/standards-bodies/)** | Organizations developing AI standards |

### Epistemic & Coordination Tools

Technologies and mechanisms for collective intelligence:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Epistemic Tools](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/)** | Prediction markets, forecasting, verification systems |
| **[Coordination Technologies](/knowledge-base/responses/epistemic-tools/coordination-tech/)** | Tools for large-scale cooperation |

### Field Building & Resilience

Growing capacity and preparing for challenges:

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[Field Building](/knowledge-base/responses/field-building/)** | Growing the AI safety community |
| **[Resilience](/knowledge-base/responses/resilience/)** | Building societal capacity to handle AI disruption |

## Evaluation Framework

When evaluating interventions, consider:

### Importance (Scale)
- How much risk reduction if successful?
- Does it address a critical bottleneck?

### Tractability
- Is meaningful progress possible?
- What's the track record?

### Neglectedness
- How much work is already happening?
- What's the marginal value of more resources?

## How Worldviews Affect Priorities

Your beliefs about AI risk affect which interventions look most promising:

| If you believe... | Prioritize... |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Short timelines (&lt;5 years) | Governance, existing systems, immediate impact |
| Alignment is very hard | Technical research, fundamental breakthroughs |
| Misuse is the main risk | Access controls, monitoring, defensive capabilities |
| Racing dynamics dominate | International coordination, industry agreements |
| Institutions work well | Policy advocacy, standards development |

## Getting Involved

Different backgrounds enable different contributions:

| Background | Potential Contributions |
|------------|------------------------|
| **Technical** | Alignment research, interpretability, evaluations |
| **Policy** | Governance research, legislative work, standards |
| **Operations** | Supporting research organizations |
| **Communications** | Public engagement, translating research |
| **Funding** | Grantmaking, donor advising |
