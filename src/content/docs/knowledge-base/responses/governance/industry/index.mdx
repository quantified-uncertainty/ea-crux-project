## Overview

In the absence of comprehensive regulation, **AI labs have developed their own governance frameworks**. These include responsible scaling policies (RSPs), voluntary commitments, and industry standards.

## Key Frameworks

### Responsible Scaling Policies

Labs with public RSPs include:
- **Anthropic** — First to publish RSP framework
- **OpenAI** — Preparedness Framework
- **DeepMind** — Frontier Safety Framework

### Voluntary Commitments

Major industry commitments include:
- **White House Voluntary Commitments** (July 2023) — 15+ labs
- **Frontier Model Forum** — Industry coordination body
- **Partnership on AI** — Multi-stakeholder guidelines

## Evaluation

| Strength | Weakness |
|----------|----------|
| Faster than legislation | No enforcement mechanism |
| Technically informed | May be weakened under competitive pressure |
| Adaptable | Potential for "ethics washing" |
| Demonstrates good faith | Doesn't cover all actors |

## Key Questions

- Can self-regulation be trusted without external oversight?
- How do RSPs interact with regulation?
- What happens when competitive pressure increases?
