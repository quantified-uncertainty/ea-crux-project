title: Worldview Profiles
description: How beliefs cluster into coherent positions on AI safety.
---

People's views on AI safety tend to cluster into recognizable worldviews. Each worldview combines beliefs about risk, feasibility, and strategy into a coherent package.

## Major Worldviews

| Worldview | Core Belief | P(doom) | Priority Approaches |
|-----------|-------------|---------|---------------------|
| [AI Doomer](/worldviews/doomer) | Alignment is very hard; timelines short | 30-90% | Pause, agent foundations, governance |
| [Optimistic Alignment](/worldviews/optimistic) | Alignment is tractable engineering | <5% | RLHF, evals, lab culture |
| [Governance-Focused](/worldviews/governance-focused) | Technical solutions need policy support | 10-30% | Policy, compute governance, coordination |
| [Long-Timelines Technical](/worldviews/long-timelines) | We have time for careful research | 5-20% | Interpretability, agent foundations |

## How Worldviews Form

Your worldview emerges from your answers to key cruxes:

```
Short timelines? ──┬── Yes ──► Alignment hard? ──┬── Yes ──► DOOMER
                   │                              └── No ───► Urgent but optimistic
                   │
                   └── No ───► Alignment hard? ──┬── Yes ──► LONG-TIMELINES TECHNICAL
                                                 └── No ───► OPTIMISTIC ALIGNMENT
```

Governance-focused worldview cuts across these based on belief that technical solutions alone are insufficient.

## Using This Section

1. **Identify your worldview**: Which profile is closest to your current beliefs?
2. **Understand alternatives**: What would you need to believe to hold a different view?
3. **Find cruxes**: Where do you differ from other worldviews?
4. **Steel-man**: Can you articulate the strongest version of views you disagree with?

## Cross-Cutting Dimensions

Some beliefs vary within each worldview:

| Dimension | Spectrum |
|-----------|----------|
| AI assistance | Trust AI to help with safety ↔ Keep humans in charge |
| Open source | Net positive ↔ Net negative |
| Lab work | Change from inside ↔ Change from outside |
| Theory vs. empirical | Formal methods ↔ Experimental safety |
