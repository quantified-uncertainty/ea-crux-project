title: Governance-Focused Worldview
description: Technical solutions need policy and coordination to work.
---

**Core belief**: Whether alignment is technically tractable or not, the bottleneck is getting good solutions adopted. Governance, coordination, and institutional change are the key levers.

## Characteristic Beliefs

| Crux | Typical Governance-Focused Position |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| Timelines | Enough for governance to matter |
| Alignment difficulty | Important but not the only factor |
| Coordination | Crucial and achievable |
| Lab incentives | Won't naturally prioritize safety enough |
| Policy effectiveness | Can meaningfully shape outcomes |
| International dynamics | Key to overall outcome |
| P(doom) | 10-30% (varies) |

## Priority Approaches

Given these beliefs, governance-focused people prioritize:

1. **Governance & policy**: Regulations, standards, oversight
2. **Compute governance**: Physical chokepoints
3. **International coordination**: Especially US-China
4. **Lab safety culture**: Change from inside
5. **Evals & standards**: Create accountability

## Deprioritized Approaches

| Approach | Why less important |
|----------|-------------------|
| Agent foundations | Too theoretical, not actionable |
| Pause advocacy | May prefer incremental governance |
| Interpretability | Useful but not main lever |

## Key Organizations

- Center for AI Safety (policy arm)
- GovAI
- Center for AI Policy
- Many think tanks

## Strongest Arguments

1. Even with perfect technical solutions, need adoption
2. Labs face competitive pressure to cut corners
3. International dynamics could overwhelm any single actor's safety
4. Policy shapes what research gets done
5. Historical precedent: technology governance works

## Weakest Points / Common Critiques

- Overestimates policy effectiveness
- Government moves too slowly for AI
- Regulatory capture is likely
- International coordination may be impossible
- Doesn't address fundamental technical problems

## What Would Change This View?

- Evidence that governance can't influence AI development
- Technical solutions that work regardless of adoption
- Fundamental impossibility of coordination
- Regulatory interventions backfiring consistently
