title: AI Doomer Worldview
description: Short timelines, hard alignment, high risk.
---

**Core belief**: Advanced AI will be developed soon, alignment is fundamentally hard, and catastrophe is likely unless drastic action is taken.

## Characteristic Beliefs

| Crux | Typical Doomer Position |
|------|------------------------|
| Timelines | AGI likely within 10-15 years |
| Paradigm | Scaling may be sufficient |
| Takeoff | Could be fast (weeks-months) |
| Alignment difficulty | Fundamentally hard, not just engineering |
| Instrumental convergence | Strong and default |
| Deceptive alignment | Significant risk |
| Current techniques | Won't scale to superhuman |
| Coordination | Likely to fail |
| P(doom) | 30-90% |

## Priority Approaches

Given these beliefs, doomers prioritize:

1. **Pause/slowdown advocacy**: Buy time for safety research
2. **Agent foundations**: Need deep theoretical solutions
3. **Interpretability**: Must detect deception
4. **Governance**: Coordinate to prevent racing
5. **Compute governance**: Physical control points

## Deprioritized Approaches

| Approach | Why less important |
|----------|-------------------|
| RLHF improvements | Won't scale to superhuman |
| Lab safety culture | Insufficient without structural change |
| Evals | Can't catch deceptive alignment |
| AI-assisted alignment | Bootstrapping is dangerous |

## Key Proponents

- Eliezer Yudkowsky
- Many MIRI researchers
- Some Conjecture researchers
- Various independent researchers

## Strongest Arguments

1. The default outcome of creating something smarter than us is that it pursues its own goals
2. Alignment must be solved before AGI, not after—you can't iterate on existential risk
3. Current success with RLHF says nothing about superhuman alignment
4. Racing dynamics are already visible and worsening

## Weakest Points / Common Critiques

- Overconfident in short timelines
- Underrates potential for alignment progress
- Dismisses current safety work too quickly
- Policy proposals may be politically unrealistic
- May be overly influenced by specific intuitions

## What Would Change This View?

- Clear evidence of significant alignment progress
- Long periods without capability jumps
- Coordination success
- Demonstrations that current techniques scale
