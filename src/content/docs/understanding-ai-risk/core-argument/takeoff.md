title: Will Takeoff Be Fast?
description: How quickly will AI go from human-level to superhuman?

**The claim**: Once AI reaches human-level capabilities, the transition to superhuman could be very fast (weeks to months), leaving no time to react.

## Why Takeoff Speed Matters

| If takeoff is... | Then... |
|-----------------|---------|
| Fast (days-months) | We get one shot; must solve alignment before deployment |
| Medium (1-5 years) | Some time to react, but limited |
| Slow (decades) | Can iterate, learn from mistakes, adapt governance |

## Arguments for Fast Takeoff

- **Recursive self-improvement**: AI improves AI, creating feedback loops
- **Speed advantage**: AI thinks faster than humans, works 24/7
- **No physical constraints**: Software improvements happen instantly
- **Copying**: One capable AI can become millions
- **Secrecy**: Capability gains might not be visible externally

**Key proponents**: Eliezer Yudkowsky, MIRI researchers

## Arguments for Slow Takeoff

- **Real-world bottlenecks**: Deployment, integration, trust take time
- **Multiple competing systems**: No single AI dominates
- **Hardware constraints**: Compute is limited, takes time to build
- **Economic friction**: Organizations adopt technology slowly
- **Historical pattern**: Past transformative technologies took decades

**Key proponents**: Paul Christiano, economists

## The Discontinuity Question

| Continuous progress | Discontinuous jump |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Each generation slightly better | Sudden capability explosion |
| Multiple actors, gradual shift | Single actor gains decisive advantage |
| Warning signs visible | Surprise capability gains |

## Empirical Signals to Watch

- Do AI labs make sudden capability jumps, or gradual progress?
- Is AI research progress accelerating faster than expected?
- Are recursive self-improvement loops already emerging?
- How concentrated is cutting-edge AI development?

## Your Crux

If we develop human-level AI, probability that within 2 years:
- We have AI with decisive strategic advantage: ____%
- Multiple roughly-matched superhuman AIs exist: ____%
- AI is still roughly human-level: ____%
- We've had time to observe and adapt: ____%
