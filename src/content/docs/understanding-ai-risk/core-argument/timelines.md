**The claim**: Transformative AI (AI that could radically change civilization) will be developed in the coming decades, not centuries.

## Key Sub-Questions

| Question | Short Timelines View | Long Timelines View |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| AGI by 2030? | 20-50% | <10% |
| AGI by 2050? | 70-90% | 30-50% |
| Scaling sufficient? | Probably yes | Probably needs new paradigms |
| Current progress representative? | Yes, will continue | May plateau |

## Arguments for Short Timelines

- Current progress is faster than predicted
- Scaling laws show consistent improvement
- Major labs explicitly targeting AGI
- Massive investment ($100B+/year)
- Few obvious technical barriers remaining

**Key proponents**: Many OpenAI/Anthropic researchers, various forecasters

## Arguments for Long Timelines

- Past AI predictions were overoptimistic
- Current systems lack key capabilities (reasoning, planning, learning efficiency)
- Integration with real world is harder than benchmarks suggest
- May need fundamental breakthroughs
- "AGI" may be an incoherent concept

**Key proponents**: Some academic researchers, skeptics of scaling

## The Paradigm Sub-Crux

A crucial sub-question: **Will scaling current architectures (transformers) reach AGI?**

| View | Implication for Timelines |
|------|---------------------------|
| Scaling is sufficient | Timelines depend mainly on compute availability |
| Need new paradigms | Timelines depend on unpredictable breakthroughs |

## Why This Matters for Risk

| If timelines are... | Then... |
|--------------------|---------|
| Short (5-15 years) | Current safety research is all we have; urgency is extreme |
| Medium (15-30 years) | Time for one major research paradigm; governance matters |
| Long (30+ years) | Multiple generations of researchers; hard to predict |

## Your Crux

What's your probability of transformative AI by:
- 2030: ____%
- 2040: ____%  
- 2060: ____%

What evidence would significantly change these estimates?
