These models offer different lenses for analyzing AI existential risk. Each emphasizes different causal mechanisms and intervention points.

## Available Models

| Model | Core Thesis | Key Variables | Best For |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| [Capability-Alignment Race](/models/capability-alignment-race) | Risk emerges from the gap between capability progress and safety readiness | Compute, interpretability, governance, deployment pressure | Technical researchers, policy analysts |
| [Multi-Actor Strategic Landscape](/models/multi-actor-landscape) | Risk depends on which actors develop TAI and their incentive structures | US-China competition, transparency, first-mover advantage | Geopolitical analysts, governance researchers |
| [Technical Pathway Decomposition](/models/technical-pathways) | Different architectures create distinct risk profiles | Scaling, agency, safety techniques, dangerous capabilities | ML researchers, technical safety teams |
| [Societal Response & Adaptation](/models/societal-response) | Humanity's collective response determines outcomes more than technical factors | Public concern, institutional capacity, coordination mechanisms | Policy researchers, social scientists |
| [Feedback Loop & Cascade](/models/feedback-loops) | Risk emerges from reinforcing feedback loops that accelerate through thresholds | Investment cycles, threshold crossings, cascade dynamics | Systems thinkers, risk analysts |
| [Critical Uncertainties](/models/critical-uncertainties) | Focus on high-leverage, genuinely uncertain, empirically resolvable variables | Compute, algorithms, governance, capability thresholds | Forecasters, quantitative analysts |

## Model Comparison

| Dimension | Race Model | Strategic Model | Technical Model | Societal Model | Feedback Model | Uncertainties Model |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Focus** | Progress differential | Actor dynamics | Architecture risks | Collective response | Dynamic systems | Resolvable parameters |
| **Intervention Point** | Speed of alignment vs capability | Coordination & incentives | Technical design choices | Public opinion, institutions | Loop dampening, thresholds | High-leverage variables |
| **Key Uncertainty** | Will alignment scale? | Who leads and how? | Which capabilities emerge? | Will society respond in time? | Which loops dominate? | What can we measure? |
| **Policy Relevance** | Safety investment, deployment rules | International coordination | Technical standards | Media, education, governance | Timing of interventions | Forecasting, tracking |
| **Assumptions** | Current paradigm continues | Multiple relevant actors | Architecture matters | Democratic institutions persist | System dynamics apply | Variables are measurable |

## How to Use These Models

1. **Identify your worldview**: Which causal story resonates most?
2. **Focus on high-leverage nodes**: Which variables have most downstream impact?
3. **Find your cruxes**: Which parameters are you most uncertain about?
4. **Explore interventions**: What changes to inputs most reduce total risk?

## Key Insights Across Models

All six models converge on several themes:

- **Speed matters**: Faster capability development increases risk
- **Transparency helps**: Information sharing reduces coordination failures
- **Autonomy is dangerous**: More agentic systems are harder to control
- **Governance is weak**: Current coordination capacity is insufficient
- **Multiple pathways**: Risk comes from accident, misuse, AND structural failures

## Creating Your Own Model

These models are starting points. You might:

1. **Combine elements**: Use technical variables with strategic framing
2. **Add variables**: Include factors we've missed
3. **Adjust weights**: Use your own probability estimates
4. **Change structure**: Different causal relationships

The goal is productive disagreement: identifying which specific variables and connections people actually disagree about.
