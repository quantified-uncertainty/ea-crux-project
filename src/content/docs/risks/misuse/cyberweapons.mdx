## Overview

AI systems can enhance offensive cyber capabilities in several ways: discovering vulnerabilities in software, generating exploit code, automating attack campaigns, and evading detection. This shifts the offense-defense balance and may enable more frequent, sophisticated, and scalable cyber attacks.

Unlike some AI risks that remain theoretical, AI-assisted cyber attacks are already occurring and advancing rapidly.

## How AI Enhances Cyber Offense

In vulnerability discovery, AI can analyze code to find security flaws faster than human researchers. Large language models can identify patterns associated with vulnerabilities and suggest exploits. This capability already exists in security research tools and offensive applications.

For exploit development, AI can help write malware, generate phishing content, and automate attack code. Language models can produce functional exploit code for known vulnerabilities and potentially assist with novel exploit development.

In attack automation, AI can manage many simultaneous attacks, adapt to defenses in real-time, and operate at speeds humans can't match. AI-powered attacks could be more persistent, adaptive, and scalable than current approaches.

For social engineering, AI can generate convincing phishing messages personalized to targets, conduct realistic voice/video impersonation, and automate large-scale deception campaigns.

## Current State

AI is already integrated into both offensive and defensive cybersecurity. Commercial security products use AI for threat detection. Offensive tools increasingly incorporate AI assistance. State actors are known to be investing in AI cyber capabilities.

Demonstrations have shown language models can help with various stages of cyber attacks, though current systems still require significant human expertise. The gap between AI-assisted and fully autonomous attacks is closing.

## Offense-Defense Balance

A key question is whether AI helps offense or defense more. Arguments for offense advantage: attacks only need to find one vulnerability while defense must protect everything. AI accelerates the already-faster attack cycle. Scaling attacks is easier than scaling defenses.

Arguments for defense advantage: defenders have more data about their own systems. Detection can leverage AI for anomaly identification. Many attacks are preventable with good security hygiene that AI can help implement.

The balance likely varies by context and over time. Currently, AI seems to be providing significant advantages to both sides, with the net effect unclear.

## Systemic Risks

Beyond individual attacks, AI-enabled cyber capabilities create systemic risks. Critical infrastructure becomes more vulnerable if attacks are more frequent and sophisticated. Cyber conflict between nations could escalate faster than human decision-makers can manage. The proliferation of offensive AI tools to criminals and terrorists enables non-state threats at state-level capability.

Economic damage from cyberattacks already runs to hundreds of billions annually. AI could significantly increase this.

## Mitigations

Technical defenses include AI-powered security tools that can match AI-enabled attacks. Proactive vulnerability discovery using AI can find and patch flaws before attackers do.

Governance approaches include international agreements on AI cyber weapons (though enforcement is difficult), responsible disclosure norms for AI-discovered vulnerabilities, and limiting access to the most capable offensive AI tools.

Defensive investment is crucial—ensuring AI advances benefit defense at least as much as offense requires deliberate focus on security applications of AI.
