## Overview

AI can strengthen authoritarian control through surveillance, censorship, propaganda, and prediction of dissent. The concern isn't just that AI enables human rights abuses today, but that AI-enabled authoritarianism might become stable and durable—harder to resist or overthrow than historical autocracies.

This represents both an immediate harm and a potential lock-in of bad political systems.

## Capabilities for Control

AI surveillance allows comprehensive monitoring of populations, as described in [Mass Surveillance](/risks/misuse/surveillance). When combined with other tools, surveillance becomes part of an integrated control system.

AI censorship can automatically detect and remove forbidden content at scale. Rather than employing armies of human censors, AI can flag content for removal in real-time across all platforms. Content moderation AI developed for legitimate purposes can be repurposed for political censorship.

AI propaganda enables personalized messaging to citizens, potentially more effective than traditional mass propaganda. AI can generate content, target it precisely, and measure its effects.

Predictive suppression uses AI to identify likely dissidents or protests before they act. By analyzing behavior patterns, regimes could preemptively suppress opposition.

Social credit systems use AI to track citizen behavior, assign scores, and distribute rewards and punishments. This creates incentives for compliance without requiring explicit coercion.

## Current Deployment

China has implemented many of these tools most extensively, including pervasive surveillance, automated censorship of social media, and social credit experiments. The treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang represents the most intensive application.

Other authoritarian regimes are adopting similar technologies, often purchasing from Chinese or other suppliers. Surveillance technology exports have grown significantly.

Some democratic governments use similar tools in more limited ways, raising questions about where the line is.

## The Stability Concern

Historical autocracies fell through revolutions, coups, or external pressure. AI might make these harder. Comprehensive surveillance can detect organizing before it becomes effective. Predictive systems can identify dissidents early. Information control can prevent coordination.

If AI enables stable authoritarianism, billions could live under repressive regimes indefinitely. This makes AI-enabled authoritarianism a potential source of locked-in bad outcomes.

## Export and Spread

AI surveillance and control technologies are exported globally. China's "Safe Cities" and similar programs have spread to dozens of countries. Democratic countries also export dual-use technology.

Once established, these systems are hard to remove. Infrastructure persists across regime changes. Technical dependencies on suppliers continue.

## Countermeasures

Export controls could limit spread of surveillance technology, though enforcement is difficult and dual-use nature complicates restrictions.

Privacy-preserving technology and circumvention tools can help individuals evade surveillance, though this is an asymmetric contest.

Democratic resilience requires understanding these tools to defend against them. AI could also enhance democratic participation if developed with that goal.

International pressure and norms could stigmatize AI-enabled authoritarianism, though effectiveness varies.
