## Overview

Human agency—the capacity to make meaningful choices that shape one's life and the world—may be eroding as AI systems increasingly mediate, predict, and direct human behavior. Unlike enfeeblement (losing capability), erosion of agency concerns losing meaningful control even while retaining capability.

This is already happening in limited ways. The question is whether AI will intensify this enough to fundamentally change what human life means.

## Current Manifestations

Algorithmic curation shapes what people see, read, and consume. Recommendation systems determine information diet for billions. While users technically choose, the choice set is algorithmically determined.

Behavioral prediction allows AI to anticipate and influence decisions. If AI knows what you'll choose and can shape the context of choice, how meaningful is the choice?

Automated decisions affect people in ways they can't see or appeal. Lending decisions, hiring processes, criminal justice predictions, and social services increasingly involve algorithmic components that affected individuals don't understand or control.

Addiction engineering uses AI to optimize for engagement, exploiting psychological vulnerabilities. People spend time in ways they wouldn't endorse if asked, pulled by algorithms optimized to maximize attention capture.

## Mechanisms

Opacity means people don't understand the systems affecting them. Algorithmic decisions are often unexplainable, even to their creators. When you can't understand what's shaping your options, your agency is diminished.

Asymmetry means AI systems know more about people than people know about themselves. This information asymmetry enables manipulation and nudging that individuals can't perceive or resist.

Scale means individuals face AI systems backed by massive data and compute. The contest between individual human and sophisticated AI influence system is unequal.

Lock-in means once people are embedded in AI-mediated systems, exit becomes costly or impossible. Network effects, data dependencies, and infrastructure integration create capture.

## Is This New?

Humans have always been influenced by their environment, social context, and information sources. AI may be different in degree rather than kind. But degree matters. If AI influence becomes comprehensive enough, the residual space for genuine human choice may shrink to insignificance.

The qualitative shift might occur when AI models human psychology well enough to reliably produce desired behaviors—when "free will" becomes a useful fiction rather than a meaningful description.

## Why It Matters

Intrinsically, human agency may have value independent of outcomes. A life of externally directed experiences might be impoverished even if pleasant.

Instrumentally, agency enables correction of errors. If humans can't choose differently, mistakes become permanent. Democratic governance assumes meaningful citizen choice; if citizens are manipulable, democracy fails.

For AI safety specifically, human oversight of AI requires genuine human agency. If AI shapes human choices, "human oversight" becomes circular.

## Responses

Transparency requirements could require that AI systems be understandable by those they affect.

Friction could slow AI-mediated choices, creating space for reflection rather than impulse.

Adversarial protection could develop AI tools that protect human agency rather than exploit it.

Regulatory limits could restrict the most manipulative applications.

Cultural emphasis on agency could resist the temptation to outsource all decisions to AI.
