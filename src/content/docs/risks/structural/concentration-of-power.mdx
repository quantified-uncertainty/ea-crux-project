## Overview

AI could enable small groups—companies, governments, or individuals—to accumulate and exercise power at scales previously impossible. The concern isn't just inequality (which has always existed) but a qualitative shift in what power concentration looks like when AI can substitute for large numbers of humans across many domains.

A world where a handful of entities control the most powerful AI systems might look very different from today's distribution of power.

## Mechanisms of Concentration

AI capability concentration occurs because cutting-edge AI requires massive compute resources, rare talent, and proprietary data that only a few organizations can assemble. The leading AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta) and perhaps a few others have resources others can't match.

Economic concentration follows from AI's ability to automate across industries. If a single AI system can replace many workers across many sectors, the owners of that system capture value that previously went to distributed labor. Winner-take-all dynamics may intensify.

Political and military concentration occurs when AI provides decisive advantages in surveillance, prediction, and force application. States with advanced AI gain power over those without. Within states, those controlling AI systems gain power over those who don't.

Information concentration comes from AI's ability to process and generate information at scale. Those controlling large language models and recommendation systems shape what billions of people see and think.

## Historical Context

Power has always been unequally distributed. But certain technologies have shifted the balance dramatically. Nuclear weapons concentrated military power in a few states. The internet concentrated information power in a few platforms.

AI might be more transformative than either because it applies across all domains. Unlike nuclear weapons (which only threaten destruction) or the internet (which primarily affects information), AI could provide advantages in economics, politics, research, and military affairs simultaneously.

## Scenarios

Benevolent concentration involves power concentrated in hands that use it well—a capable AI lab or government that uses advanced AI to solve problems effectively. Even optimistic scenarios raise questions about accountability and sustainability.

Malevolent concentration involves power concentrated in hands that abuse it—an authoritarian state or reckless company using AI dominance for control or profit at others' expense.

Competitive concentration involves multiple powerful actors competing with AI, potentially creating instability, arms races, and conflict.

Fragmented power involves broad access to AI preventing concentration—but this may also enable distributed misuse.

## Why This Matters

If power becomes too concentrated, traditional checks—democratic accountability, market competition, international balance—may not function. Those with power could reshape rules to entrench their position. Lock-in of bad outcomes becomes possible.

Even well-intentioned concentration is concerning. No small group should unilaterally determine humanity's future, regardless of their intentions. The current structure of AI development—private companies making decisions with global implications—may not be appropriate for the technology's significance.

## Responses

Governance approaches might include antitrust action, public investment in AI, international agreements on AI development, and democratic oversight of AI deployment.

Technical approaches might include open-source AI development, distributed compute access, and privacy-preserving techniques that limit data advantages.

The fundamental tension: benefiting from AI's power while preventing that power from concentrating dangerously is one of the defining challenges of AI governance.
